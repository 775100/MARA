 - May 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X2 &&& 1.6.2&&&SUPER AMAZING&&&I'm a truck driver and when you drive from the night into the morning you'll accumulate a split time pattern. With the new technology and new computer systems within these trucks you MUST calculate you times accurately and luckily this app helped me majorly in my case. Worth spending a dollar for, instead of my losing hundreds of dollars out of my checks. Thanks.
 - August 11, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 1.6.2&&&Perfect&&&I use it in the operating room to convert surgery time into minutes for charting. Spend some time getting familiar with it. It's great!!!
 - February 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Wildfire &&& 1.6.2&&&Top of the crop&&&My advice is to ignore the negative comments about the literature version, and jump in and pay the small and very reasonable amount for this pro version. Intuitive layout and all the functions you need to be able to perform time calculations. I use it primarily for work to calculate the totals for my flexitime sheet, but it's useful in any situation where you need to perform a calculation of time.

 - May 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.6.2&&&Simple and powerful&&&I've used other time calculators that just didn't have the functionality I needed, but this one is great. I really like how "simple" it is, in the sense that you have a lot of control over calculations and can use different formats for time. It would be nice to have a sort of history pane that can be scrolled through to see previous entries. Definitely worth it to go pro.
