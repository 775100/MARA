 - July 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.62&&&Best auto brightness app out there!&&&This is a great app to "fine tune" the auto brightness in Android. Get it really dim so you can read while in bed, dimmer than stock indoors so you can save batteries, and 100% brightness when out in the direct sun so you can still see your screen! Works flawlessly!
 - July 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.61&&&Much Better than Stock&&&
 - July 4, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.61&&&Messed up my dialer&&&Couldn't end,  mute or interact with dialer after enabling lux on 4.1
 - July 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.61&&&Does what it says&&&Updates quickly and doesn't seem to affect battery life
 - June 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.60&&&Never ending battle with stock auto brightness&&&Always had to manually adjust till I found this! Works great! Its one of those apps that should be included by default but never. Thanks!
 - July 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 0.60&&&Best.&&&Best app to work with brightness.If you don't like default brightness settings,this is app you really need.Doesn't eat battery, simple to use.
 - July 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.60&&&Works great!&&&Thanks for the Jelly Bean fix
 - June 27, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.60&&&Frequently doesn't adjust brightness&&&Set on auto. It often is too dark. I then open lux and have to hit "scan". It then adjusts ok. BUT,I then exit lux and it immediately reverts back to dark. Repeat, repeat, repeat.... Finally, need to turn it off.   When opening lux, it automatically takes 5 seconds to scan, blocking my access to the controls and wasting my time. All I want to do is turn the dysfunctional autoadjust feature off but I'm waiting for the auto scan to finish and let me.   Frustrating.
 - June 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 0.60&&&Galaxy s2&&&Once set up it works lovely!
 - June 30, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 0.60&&&Poor performance on Samsung Galaxy S3&&&
 - June 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Nexus One &&& 0.60&&&Great&&&Incredible app and keeps improving. Should be the standard!
 - July 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Exhibit 2 4G &&& 0.60&&&genius&&&Must buy pro to be useful on exhibit ii due to no light sensor. But camera as sensor works great! Genius. Only samples at screen turn on but that is fine. You can still tell out to resample manually if needed using widget. Worth the money.
 - July 3, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 0.60&&&Astronomy mode is stupid.&&&Adds a red overlay and prevents the screen from going as dim as it can without. Exactly what you don't want in dark-critical conditions. But the dimming is more intelligent than what my phone does on its own.
July 3, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid II &&& 0.60&&&Finally - outside makes it brighter&&&
 - July 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire S &&& 0.60&&&Works well, beautiful UI&&&I've tried one other similar app, but that didn't have a widget or clear controls. I like the way this app has a widget which can display the app or adjust brightness. Some slight twitchiness with the auto/dynamic setting, but that may be down to quirks in my phone's sensor - auto/periodic seems to fix it. There are many configuration options, but the well-designed UI makes the most useful ones easily accessible. Not sure how much I'll use astronomer mode, though.
 - July 3, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 0.60&&&Ok on s3&&&Slightly buggy sometimes but overall good
 - July 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 0.60&&&Truly Excellent.&&&Vastly superior to the built in auto brightness.  And it has Tasker integration!
 - June 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC One S &&& 0.51&&&Shame on phone makers...&&&This app poops on the factory/android software used for auto brightness... And the ability to let it learn your preference is stellar A MUST HAVE APP ON ANY DEVICE
 - May 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 0.51&&&Brilliant&&&I tried loads of these type apps and they were crap... I bit the bullet and this is brilliant! Better than the stock cause you can set a brightness for a specific environment 0.98p well spent!
 - May 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.51&&&It's F.lux for your android.(Nook Color)&&&I've been searching for an app that duplicates the effect that 'F.Lux's by steriopics has on my computer.  This is the best thing.  Developer even promises our money back if we don't like it.  You sir are being recommended on XDA.
 - April 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Defy &&& 0.51&&&Great so far&&&I really like the simple and intuitive way this app works! It's how auto brightness should have been implemented in the first place - adjusting the display relative the ambient light in a smooth way, that can be modified by the user. Highly Recommend!
 - May 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.51&&&Absolutely works&&&A little annoyed with myself as I've been manually setting my backlight due to the GN/Android's poor implementation. Wish I would have found this earlier.
 - May 4, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 0.51&&&SHAME it uses up more battery than my display... Is this due to auto ...&&&SHAME it uses up more battery than my display... Is this due to auto brightness? Screen Filter never even appeared in the % usage list.
 - May 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 0.51&&&htc sensation ics 4.0&&&Excellent there definitely isn't a better backlight controller than this, easy to set up and customize light readings and behavior. It's sadly rare that you come across apps this well thought out and executed
 - May 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.51&&&Great for the Galaxy Nexus&&&One of my main complaints with the nexus was that the screen brightness took too long to respond and was always a little dimmer than I wanted.  This app solves those two issues perfectly!  Now, after editing just two linked samples, it always looks how I want.  Thanks a ton!
 - April 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Exhibit 2 4G &&& 0.51&&&A saver of samsung exhibit&&&The new version fixes the luma bug on exhibit phone which does not have a light sensor and thus saves the autobrightness feature there. Not to mention that trained interpolation is how autobrightness should have been implemented to begin with. One of the rare ocasions i truly enjoyed the intelligence of a phone app.
 - May 2, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 0.51&&&Super easy&&&And it works great so far, I was using juice defender but it was messing up with my current Rom, but I love how much you can configure it
 - June 16, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 0.51&&&Would have been a 5&&&Would have been a 5. But it's the second highest battery drain on my phone after Screen. So 2 stars.
 - May 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.51&&&Fantastic app! It's just want I needed.&&&The developers put a lot of thought into Lux's easy to use interface. Auto adjustments are smooth and there are plenty of ways to customize it. My favorite option is astronomy mode. It would've been very helpful on my vacation! Thanks Dev!
 - May 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 0.51&&&Must have!&&&This app should be a default app on Android. Never a screen so bright it hurts your eyes (dark ambiance) or a screen so dim you can't read a thing (like in direct sunlight). It's smart, customisable and it learns your preferred brightness levels in a quick and easy way. Worth every cent!!
 - May 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.51&&&Great app, solves display-too-dark problem.&&&HTC Desire running Runnymede_AIO_V6.0.4.3_Special_Edition ROM. Brightness when set to 'auto' was too dark for me, but I didn't want to ave to set brightness manually. Auto was fine on stock Froyo, but seems to too dark on all the custom Gingerbread+ ROMS I have tried. This app solves this behaviour perfectly. Very customisable. Good job.
 - June 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.51&&&So awesome!&&&Had a suggestion for the developer, got an email back saying the newest update included tasker support which is a billion times more awesome than my idea...  Sure enough, a few hours later the update installs and all is looking good.  I no longer care about when an official F.Lux android so will surface. This dev deserves your money, and your eyes deserve a break from that harsh light.
 - June 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 0.51&&&Razr users must try this!!&&&It works very well, it lets me lower screen glare on motorola razr... battery saver. Thanks Dev.
 - May 29, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.51&&&Dont work well&&&Very baggy tested on several phones, good idea but realisation is weak, always mess with brigth settings, could use the same "linked" setting for direct sun and in dark room. I have used other software even free one and those works better then this one. I triyed every option in settings but still unable to make it work properly
 - June 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 0.51&&&Works as advertised&&&Does a pretty good job of keeping the screen at just the right brightness. Took a bit of configuration to get it where I want but it was pretty easy.
 - May 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Exhibit 2 4G &&& 0.51&&&Can use camera for light sensor!&&&This brilliant app fixes my shite phone, which lacks auto brightness, by allowing me to use the camera as a light sensor. That option only works with the adjust-upon-unlock mode, not continuous auto, but that works ok.
 - June 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 0.51&&&A must have on the HTC One X&&&Modern screens are really bright. Which is a good thing in outdoor daylight. But when you want to read in complete darkness that's when Lux really shines. The sub zero mode is so cool! Definitely worth every penny!
 - April 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Defy &&& 0.51&&&Excellent app&&&Works so much better then the built in auto brightness control in android.  Behaves exactly the way i want after I spent a little time configuring min and max screen brightness (0%-70%).
 - May 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.51&&&Better than stock&&&I like using auto brightness, but on the Galaxy Nexus it just set it to low, making the screen dull and ugly. This app allows you to set the minimum brightness for auto. It was a little confusing to figure out at 1st, but I was a little under the influence when I installed it. It is definitely worth spending the money if you have the same issues as me.
 - June 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy W &&& 0.51&&&Muito bom&&&Recomendo! Uso a camera para regular a luminosidade.
 - June 5, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF300 &&& 0.51&&&Super&&&So far so good. I'm in test fase now. Using it for my Asus transformer 300T. Standard Auto brightness on a 300T sucks so testing this app.
 - April 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 0.51&&&Great&&&Saves my eyes late at night when everyone else is snoozing! One thing though, could you make the status icon smaller so it fits in better with the rest of the status icons?
 - May 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.51&&&Works well.&&&Works well on my Moto Droid Bionic. Was looking for something to help with battery life and this app definitely helped.
 - June 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Exhibit 2 4G &&& 0.51&&&Works great!&&&I have a galaxy exhibit 2 which doesn't have a light sensor, so I would always have to adjust my brightness manually. But not anymore! This app can use the camera to sense the brightness, and it does so very well. Plus with the linked samples feature I can tweak the brightness to whatever I like and it remembers, so if it auto  adjusts to something too bright or dull I can just fine tune and it will goto that level when it senses that brightness again. Very neat! First app I have deemed worthy enough to buy
 - May 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 0.51&&&Great!&&&A trully worthy app! Highly recommended!
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 0.51&&&Great&&&Great piece of software! Works as intended, powerful customisable brightness levels.
 - April 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 0.51&&&Brilliant app!&&&Really good as I always thought the default auto brightness was too bright
 - June 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 0.51&&&Slick design&&&Great design and good functionality. Worth every cent.
 - June 14, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 0.51&&&update please&&&can not work during running in other app
 - May 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.51&&&Bryan&&&Last update did a fix ,thanks.4.0.1 android
 - May 25, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.51&&&Nice&&&Brightness is always dark after leaving underground parking using navigation. Needs an option to dim display when battery at 4%.
 - April 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire S &&& 0.51&&&Should be part of Android&&&Much better than the Android native auto brightness.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.51&&&Get this for Galaxy Nexus&&&This is great if you have a Galaxy Nexus which has a very aggressive auto brightness.  Now you can customize it all you want.
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 0.51&&&Awesome&&&Love it
 - April 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 0.51&&&Outstanding!!&&&Absolutely a perfect app.  Dims the screen as dark as you could ever want; so effortless to use and customize.  Worth way more than it cost!!!!!
 - May 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.51&&&Yes, this is worth the money!&&&Great! Great! Great application :)
 - May 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.51&&&Can really save battery&&&Much better than stock, and if you set the levels nice and low it can make a massive difference to battery consumption.
 - April 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 0.51&&&Works great.&&&Allows me to use a much lower brightness than stock auto brightness, saving a ton of battery life.
 - May 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.51&&&Awesome&&&Love it!
 - May 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Defy &&& 0.51&&&Cool&&&That's good

 - May 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Wildfire S &&& 0.51&&&Does exactly what I wanted&&&What an effort! Well done Vito, and thanks a ton!
 - May 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 0.51&&&Marvellous&&&
 - May 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.51&&&Awsome&&&My auto dimming never worked properly. This solved that issue. Galaxy s2 cyanogen 9
 - June 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.51&&&Excellent&&&Top app, works beautifully
 - May 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.51&&&Awsome&&&Works great
 - April 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 0.51&&&Best Auto brightness&&&Stock auto brightness is almost always too bright, except when outside. This is perfect.
 - May 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 0.51&&&Amazing.&&&Wish I found this sooner!
 - May 25, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Tab &&& 0.51&&&Needs new icon.&&&

 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 0.51&&&Best/most functional brightness tool I've tried&&&
 - May 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.51&&&Works great on Galaxy Nexus&&&
 - April 4, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.50&&&Iffy on Galaxy Nexus&&&First you have to switch your brightness to 100% on your Galaxy Nexus. Then have to check the option for Sub-Zero only in the general options. Now you can start teaching Lux how to change your brightness.  I found that the automatic adjustment did not work at all for my galaxy nexus. It just didn't change the brightness until I pulled up the Dashboard.  I ended setting it up to change the brightness on wake and that seems to work ok. I still wish I could have the program react to the brightness automatically.
 - April 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.50&&&WORKS AS ADVERTIZED&&&Which is much better than all other products (free or paid) that I've tried.
 - April 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.50&&&Love it&&&Allows me to fine tune the auto brightness on my galaxy nexus. Extremely happy with the results!
 - March 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.50&&&inconsistent on gnex&&&doesn't always work on gnex, especially when i got outside
 - March 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.50&&&Absolutely excellent app. Does exactly what it should.&&&I've been using this app for a few months now and it has performed very well over that time.
 - April 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 0.50&&&Finally!&&&Works perfectly on my Epic Touch 4G with minor tweaking. The stock auto-brightness sucks.
 - March 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.50&&&Good app&&&works on sh-01d. would be better if color temperature can be adjusted automatically
 - April 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.50&&&Excellent&&&Lots of configuration potential. Needs a lot of tweaking, but very powerful and saves a noticeable amount of battery.
 - March 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 0.50&&&Amazing!&&&So much better than other screen brightness apps such as root dim or screen filter. works perfectly on razr (except the soft key dimmer)
 - March 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Incredible S &&& 0.50&&&5*&&&Amazing, money well spent.
 - March 30, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.50&&&Much better than the built in auto-brightness&&&Would give it 5 stars if there were a slightly better way to get to it's dashboard.
 - April 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 0.50&&&Awesome&&&Real, managed backlight adjustment. Wow. Buy it.
 - April 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 0.50&&&good app&&&Howebver while watching videos compatibility mode sometimes stops working and turns auto brightness on.
 - April 4, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 0.50&&&Drains battery&&&Works nicely but it consumes 11% - 20% of battery.
 - March 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Lenovo Indigo &&& 0.40.7&&&So far I like it!&&&TPT native light sensor is crap  (prb'ly the driver), and the software reading it is just as bad.  I'll be watching for battery drain using the camera, which is a fantastic alternative (as long as it's the ffc). Tried a couple others, but this one is muchly so much much easier to set up & adjust. I love the devs confidence in the product!
 - February 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 0.40.7&&&Wish I knew earlier!&&&4 years ago when I switched to Android the only thing I missed about my iPhone was its Auto-Brightness ability, now I have this, and life is good. A must download!
 - March 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.40.7&&&awesome&&&this app works quite brilliantly on the droid razr maxx.  seamless operation.  helps fix one of the more annoying things about the phone.  it will now dim back down when going into a dark room.  being able to set thresholds for dimming (and of course brightening) as little or much as i want to is great since the razr is quite bright on its lowest default brightness setting.  professional and responsive support from the developer as well.
 - March 2, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.40.7&&&Gets confused on galaxy nexus&&&Initially I thought this was great but either the galaxy nexus does not provide a wide enough range of brightness values or something is wrong but as much as I have tried linking new values and resetting to defaults the screen is either too bright or too dim. Uninstalling and simply adjusting the brightness by hand.
 - February 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 0.40.7&&&Great app!&&&Was looking for app like this for ages. It is still not perfect, but is much better than competitors, therefore five stars. Please keep up good work!
 - February 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.40.7&&&Wow!&&&I love how smoothly and flawlessly this app switches brightness. Definitely much better than the stock brightness controls on my GN!
 - February 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 0.40.7&&&Great app for auto brightness control&&&Hate the stock auto brightness settings.  This app is great for custom brightness.  Epic 4g touch light sensor readings are too course tho.  Can't get good bed time reading brightness down.  the camera light sensor is finer, but this app don't have auto mode for it.  Otherwise a good app. -Epic 4G Touch
 - February 29, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 0.40.7&&&OK but uses too much battery&&&Lux uses about 10% battery on my Samsung Galaxy SII which is far too much for a power "saving" app!. Otherwise the app works well.  Peter
 - March 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.40.7&&&Works well&&&Forget all the battery savers. This app almost doubled the battery life on my AMOLED device.
 - February 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.40.7&&&Effortless&&&If you have a custom ROM like Oxygen or CyanogenMod, you can edit these brightness levels anyway - but it's so fiddly to guess what numbers are needed that many, myself included, don't bother and end up with suboptimal defaults. By contrast, the beauty of this application is easily pulling up the 'dash' over whatever you're doing (from the notifications bar) and it remembering your choice for that light level - after several weeks of this, you get something suited to you and your phone.  "Subzero" (lower than stock) dim settings are a must for night-time, it's worth it for these alone.  I was hoping colour temperature would auto-dim like F.lux after dark - unfortunately it's currently manual. The effect is also not quite the same (blacks go red rather than staying black). I reached out to the dev and got this answer within five minutes - support like this is enough for five stars!  "Auto night mode is already in the works. I use F.lux on my PC, so the idea of having a similar feature on Android has always been on the agenda. The main problem is that I currently have to use a red overlay [unless I write my own OpenGL drivers, or use Chainfire3D]. I'll have to see what we can do!"
 - March 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.40.7&&&Worth every cent!&&&Elegant and functional fix to the brightness issues on my nexus. Works great and is the best purchase I've made yet.
 - March 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 0.40.7&&&Cool&&&Simply perfect on my nexus s running ics. Now I can really use the automatic back light. Thanks!
 - February 27, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 0.40.7&&&really pretty good&&&solves apparently complicated problem - maybe hence the complex settings. Uses a fair bit of battery though (about 12% for me)...
 - March 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 0.40.7&&&Excellent&&&A very respectable developer with a very well made app.
 - March 11, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 0.40.7&&&Doesn't work at all. Galaxy Note.&&&
 - February 28, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.40.7&&&It&&&Seems to cause screen lag system wide on Galaxy Nexus. I really like this app otherwise. Hopefully it can be addressed.
 - March 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 0.40.7&&&Excellent!&&&Best app. Enables you to go beyond stock brightness controls. Thanks.
 - March 17, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 0.40.7&&&Does not work with droidx just not dependable. Fix and it will be worth ...&&&Does not work with droidx

 - February 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.40.6&&&Pretty good&&&Worth every penny! One of the first things I reinstall after flashing new roms!
 - February 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy S2 Skyrocket &&& 0.40.6&&&Samsung should pay developer!&&&A few minor bugs, but this app saved Samsung a returned phone! The galaxy skyrocket auto-brightness is too conservative but this app really brought out the beauty of my screen. Well done! Giving 5 stars because it seems to be one of a kind, so I am overlooking minor bugs.
 - February 21, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 0.40.6&&&Galaxy note&&&Good app. But i am having problems in auto mode specialy when using the browser, no matter what i select in the browser brightness. When i get out of the browser the brightness stays dim until i move the brightness slider while in auto. Adding the browser to the combatibility list & leaving the browser on auto fixed the problem

 - February 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 0.40.6&&&Excellent&&&Transformed my ATRIX screen usability. Easy to use widget. Easy to edit.
 - February 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 0.40.3&&&Superb&&&Fixed my sgs auto brightness on onecosmics rom! Excellent
 - February 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 0.40.3&&&Perfect&&&My phone has always been too bright in auto this fixed that and made a huge positive impact to battery life!
 - February 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire S &&& 0.40.3&&&great on HTC Desire S&&&just few minutes to understand how it works, and the first impression is a really good app. You can set your preferred LCD brightness as a function of the ambient light, with several "expert" customizations. I think it would be really useful (for example if you want to look your photos at full brightness) to add a easy way, as double click on the widget, to switch on/off the "auto" mode.
 - February 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 0.40.3&&&Downgraded from 5 to 2&&&Good concept works better than stock that is when it works correctly. Uninstall till an update is released.
 - February 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 0.40.3&&&Dim&&&Perfect application !! Very useful. Definitely 5 stars!!! Many thanks to the programmer
 - January 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 0.40.2&&&Brilliant!&&&Perfect, exactly what I was looking for, especially the night mode function! Astronomer mode could be a slightly darker red though, but I'm pretty light sensitive...
 - January 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 0.40&&&Exactly what I wanted&&&Does your auto brightness still make everything too bright? Get this app to customize brightness levels for every situation
 - January 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 0.30.1&&&My EVO Battery Thanks You!&&&I've been looking for an app like this, most are way too bright in the lowest light levels, love being able to set my own levels.  I've only been using it for a few days but I have already noticed a huge increase in the usage I get out of my battery.  I haven't fully tested it out yet but this seems like a developer that cares about its product and its users so I'm sure that any minor issues that pop up will likely be dealt with. Thanks for the great app!  Well worth the small investment.

 - December 11, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Galaxy S2 Skyrocket &&& 0.24.2&&&A must have app&&&Auto brightness on the GS II phones is a joke, so this app is essential. There seem to be a few bugs but in general works great, worth the price.

 - November 8, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Shooter &&& 0.23&&&4 of 5 :)&&&The best of the similar apps! Working great for now, but falls in conflict with CRT animation (if it is included into your ROM). Be warned :)
 - November 18, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.23&&&I love it but need it on my new phone!&&&I LOVE this app!!  I used it on the Exhibit II for the week that I had it but now I have a G2x and it's not compatible.  :(  Can you pleeeeease make it compatible with the G2x?
 - November 10, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G Slide &&& 0.23&&&Amazingly useful&&&Light linking feature improves on the stock auto brightness immensely.  This should really be included in AOSP...
 - November 8, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.23&&&Awesome&&&A little confusing at first, but very awesome.  Allows backlight to go nearly black if desired, perfect for using in darkness without going blind!
 - July 17, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 0.23&&&Excellent! Must have!&&&This can double your battery life. My Evo3D's screen used way too much at first. Now it's perfect. Has a learning curve. Settings need to be clearer.
 - July 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 0.23&&&Amazing! A must-have.&&&This application is a must-have for everyone. Always have a perfectly dimmed screen. I wish this feature would be integrated by default.
 - November 5, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.22&&&Essential!&&&Without this app, using my phone is a pain in the eyes! Absolutely love it, though only sometimes it doesn't adjust on power on...
 - November 24, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 0.23&&&Brilliant&&&Brilliant! Why isnt a function like this default in android....

 - October 8, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 0.19.3&&&Nice app! Change 'Link' to 'Set'&&&Great app.  My only suggestion on would be to change the terminology of 'link' to 'set'. I think the word set might be more intuitive from a usability perspective of the UI.
 - October 2, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 0.19.3&&&Nice...&&&Hope for the bug free version.  It would be great if customization for buttons and keypad intensity is added.

 - September 6, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.15&&&issue + feature request&&&Great app, but seems to have a bit of drain if you want to use it like auto brightness (setting brightness automatically periodically). Also caused home screen lag with adjust periodically turned on, like I'd swipe the home screen to the side, and it would be delayed a second or two. Works perfectly though, without periodic updating. A feature request: Would be great if updating brightness could be short cut to something like long press search key for easier access when in apps etc.
 - September 14, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 0.15&&&Samsung galaxy s fail&&&App doesn't work. The light sensor data fluctuates wildly indoors and out. The camera sensor uses the back facing camera which is dark if on desk duh!

 - June 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Samsung Galaxy S3&&&Perfect - Coming from a lazy cynic&&&I very rarely rate anything, this app is bloody magnificent. You can have it run in the background, my standby battery drain is unaffected, and it's very intuitive to use. What more could you ask for?
 - June 20, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Samsung Galaxy S&&&Terrible.&&&Much worse than the stock auto brightness on SGS. There are huge fluctuations in brightness, regardless of how it's tweaked. Plus it wastes battery.
 - June 4, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&&&&&Did not work&&&This app did not work on my HTC Vivid.  The developer says he will refund your money if it does not work.  I cancelled within Google's refund window but they did not give me a refund.  I emailed the developer, but it is now 26 days later and no refund shows up on my credit card's website. UPDATE developer did send refund after seeing my one star review.  Changed to two stars since it still did not work.
 - April 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&&&&&Just what I was after&&&The stock auto-adjust for my Galaxy Nexus always seemed to be a touch on the dark side, but with Lux I can adjust it perfectly. Thank you so much for an awesome app!
 - June 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&&&&&Awesome app!&&&Increases the user experience of my Galaxy S3 by the factor 10! Works perfectly, lighting changes smooth as butter and is just genius overall. My only question: why did this take so long (.. for me to find the app ;-))? //> Galaxy S3 + CM9 nightlies
 - June 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Samsung Galaxy S3&&&Eye saver!&&&Just got the S3 and the brightness settings are just ridiculous. Not only that but they removed the slide to change brightness. Didn't hesitate to buy this after trying the free version. Thanks
 - June 27, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&&&&&Useful&&&
 - May 7, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Samsung Galaxy S2&&&Useless Readings...&&&Does only give readings of 10, 100, 1000 & 10000 lux, although the SGS2 lightsensor gives me readings in 5-intervals from 0 to more than 200.000. Makes it a bit useless.
 - May 7, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Samsung Galaxy Note&&&Stops working&&&Always stops working for me. Uninstalled...
 - July 4, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus&&&Galaxy Nexus Jellybean&&&Since updated my phone to Android 4.1 this app blocks me from being able to answer/hang up calls, toggle speakerphone/Bluetooth, etc. in phone app.  The latest update did not fix for me.
