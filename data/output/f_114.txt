 - June 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 1.03&&&NIV is Pretty Good&&&This is a great app to use. Has great tools for searching for certain verses and able to input notes on passages you have read. I highly recommend in getting this app.
 - May 7, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 1.03&&&HTC One X&&&The study notes are supposed to download in the background through a wifi connection.  This didn't work on my HTC One X. Emailed customer support at Zondervan, they got back to me quickly, Sent me a File, and everything is working well now.  With no hitches this is a 5 star product.
 - June 5, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.03&&&Brilliant!&&&This app is a great tool for Bible study. Super-fast, sleek and easy to look at!   Considering all the media content, I expected lag and load times but no, this rocks for its purpose.  Would give an extra star if it wasn't so expensive.
 - June 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.03&&&It's a bit of a let down.&&&Disappointing. I was expecting cross references and a mini commentary like the paper version. Definitely not worth the 15 quid!
 - June 14, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Acer Picasso &&& 1.03&&&Great&&&Had trouble downloading but had great support and love the app :-)
May 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.03&&&NIV Study Bible - Awesome!&&&I absolutely love it!  The videos that are so clear, informative which give you a better understanding of what you are reading and the study notes are amazing. I can't put it down.
 - May 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.03&&&Easy to use&&&I love how easy it is to toggle back and forth from taking notes back to the word.
 - June 20, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.03&&&Crashes my tablet&&&I used ths on my phone and it runs great. On my Sprint ZTE tablet it shows all black and crashes the tablet. Hoping they will have it fixed soon.
 - June 28, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.03&&&Needs work.&&&Three stars because there's not that much between this one and the regular NIV.  And $25 is kinda steep just to add the videos, pictures, and study notes. But, it does have a very good UI.  If they added bible plans and reminders like the Bible app from Bible.tv, then I could give it four, maybe five, stars.
 - June 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 1.03&&&Excellent&&&Useful tool and resource. Works well and looks great on a tablet. First used it on a Kindle Fire and I am now using it on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9, performs nicely on both devices.
 - June 14, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 1.03&&&Downloading notes difficulty&&&Dear Sir, I am not able to complete the download of the notes into my Bible though I have tried many times.  For twice I downloaded up to 120% but it return to 0% again.  Do you have any other means to enable me to get the notes? I need it immediately. I am using Eee Pad Transformer Prime. Thank you.

 - April 30, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.02&&&Bettet style&&&Ive thouroughly reviewed many softwares. This one is the least privacy invasive. It offers the best features and this particular niv versions navigation is clean and straightforward.

 - April 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Droid Charge &&& 1.02&&&NIV  study bible&&&Super easy to use. Love the notes
 - April 26, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 1.02&&&Needs zoom&&&Great app needs text zoom, that's about it.
 - April 25, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Mini Pro &&& 1.02&&&Niv bible study&&&Good but lacks link to other Tecarta Bibles
 - April 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.02&&&Envaluable&&&
 - April 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 1.01&&&Invaluable&&&Absolutely invaluable, NIV study bible easy to use, intuitive, quick search & reference (touch and hold to access). Have maps charts shown with text (double click to enlarge) or hidden with a touch access to them and study notes. Over 50% cheaper than the print versions and it can go everywhere with you. Could use some slight revisions like dark background option for low light situations, but really that's just a personal preference. Awesome tool equipping the hungry! Thanks!
 - April 14, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 1.01&&&Great app!&&&I really love the notebook function.  I love being able to cut and paste direct from the text and incorporate into my notes.  I am not sure if there is a parallel function.  If so then I meant a 5star rating!
 - April 9, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 1.01&&&Good bones more refinement&&&This bible has the makings of a great study bible if it is fine tuned a little more.  It has great maps and pictures.  It provides some decent back ground on the text and it is easy to manipulate.  A couple things would make it great.  It needs a linked "read your bible in a year" with multiple options like old and new, start at beginning, or in chronological order.  The maps are great but should be in synch with your spot in the bible instead of having to scroll through them all each time.  This is a good bible that could be great with a little more refinement. Thanks
 - April 13, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - EeePad Slider SL101 &&& 1.01&&&Fail to load&&&The bible cannot be installed on a Asus Eeepad. I written to Tecarta many time but fail to get any respond. Be careful when downloading, the developer absolutely is not trustworthy
 - April 23, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.01&&&unable to get the app to run&&&won't run as it thinks haven't download the study contents.  tried installing and uninstalling. to no avail.  impossible to get a tech support contact.  phone # on website is invalid.  Not pleased.  I have a product that doesn't work...just blows up.
 - April 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 1.01&&&Pretty Awesome&&&This app is pretty awesome, most impressed. Easy to use, and a whole lot more than what I remember evr being in the old hard copy NIV study bible. Definately brings thestudy bible into the 21st century. And yes, it is a 'red letter' edition.
 - April 6, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.01&&&Very good but...&&&It will be perfect if it has a night view mode just like Tecarta Bible. This will help to save lots of battery consumption, and also more comfortable for the eyes to read.
 - March 31, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Vizio VTAB1008 &&& 1.01&&&Really like it&&&I really like this Bible.  Well organized and easy to navigate through.  However the interactive parts don't work! Please fix!

 - April 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.01&&&The best&&&Thank u for word
 - May 31, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Samsung Galaxy S2&&&No refund option&&&There is no refund option  in case you don't want it. Looks dodgy. No contact address in description section as well. Looks like NIV is all about money.
 - March 31, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - LG Optimus One&&&Spam-Brands your tweets&&&Notes and such are fairly solid. It does, howe er brand your tweets with product links, and you can't edit them out. Dissapointing, snce that was a major reason for buying this after they removed Twitter from share options on their regular Bibles.
