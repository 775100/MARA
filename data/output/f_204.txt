 - April 1, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.6.10&&&Great app but wont use all pictures in folder&&&This is such a great app that I bought the donation version.   I have a folder of 100+ pictures and on random picture selections, only about 20 pictures were selected randomly and all others never showed up.  I would change this to 5 stars if this could be fix or properly explained.

 - March 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 0.6.10&&&Love it...&&&Am happy to donate $1 for this app.  Only wish would be animated gif support like hilly said.  I know such a feature would probably be a resource hog, but with these new tablets and phones it wouldn't be an issue.  Can you say quad-core 1.5ghz Tegra 3?  Anyway..  thanks for the great app!!

 - June 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.6.10&&&Solid App!&&&Have been using it since my first Android (Galaxy Tab 7) and have never changed to any other Wallpaper ever since. Don't think I'll switch to another :-)  Is it possible to have a different picture for landscape and portrait mode? This is because my icon layout is at sync with the portrait mode picture, but when I have to use change to landscape, the beauty of the layout is lost.  Still 5 Stars (or more if only possible)
