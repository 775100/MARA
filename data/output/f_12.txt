 - June 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - ZTE X500 &&& 1.1&&&More planets!&&&There arent enough planets to pick from, nice to be able to customize background with asteroids or shooting stars. But, very impressed just if we aren't gunna get more planets to choose from then make the onez we do have less boring of a surface
 - June 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.1&&&Very nice!&&&I love it, looks great. Add a few space battles here and there and it will be even better :D Also more planets :)
 - June 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.1&&&Beautiful&&&Works perfectly and doesn't drain my battery like most LWP. I don't ever buy apps etc but I'm glad I bought this on a whim. Only "complaint" is the planets are some what similar looking to me. But other than that, its a gorgeous lwp pack
 - June 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.1&&&Best live wall paper I've ever used.&&&Not only is this gorgeous but the main thing I love about it is it truly does not drain my battery. Most lwp's that I've tried in the past showed significant battery drain. This one somehow fixed that band put all the rest to shame as far as the visual. Only request I can make is to add a few more planets to the mix. I heard somewhere of something like a death star looking planet. That will be killer. Thanks for the amazing work.
 - June 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1&&&Masterpiece&&&I love having wallpapers like this on my computers.  I wish that there were even more than this available.  I have the galaxy pack also, and I would encourage anyone who likes/loves this type of pix to spend the money.  To me it's completely worth the money.  To the author: If your looking for any other ideas for more live wallpapers to make, how about a pack with different types of suns, asteroid belts, comets, planets rotating suns, binary star systems.  I hope to see more work from you in the near future.
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy S2 Skyrocket &&& 1.1&&&It's a treat!&&&Long ago I asked the dev to fix a glitch on their Web site that prevented me from making a donation. I'm very pleased to have purchased this and the Galaxy Pack to encourage them too continue their outstanding work. Well done!

 - June 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1&&&Very nice!&&&Works great on Galaxy Nexus and Transformer Prime.  Smooth when changing screens left/right.  Lots of options.  Would love to see an option to tint the clouds (not just the white color) to mix with the atmosphere options.  Also, would love an option to show a nebula in the background or something like that. Overall, one of the best I've seen!  Note: It has a 'on battery' option to reduce battery drain.  Excellent!

 - July 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.1&&&T LOVE it&&&Cool graphics and design love it on my note
 - July 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1&&&Highest quality you can imagine&&&I love the idea of live wallpapers, but even if I find ones that I love, I always end up going back to static wallpapers because 1) smoothness and 2) nothing ever looks quite as crisp as a good HD picture. This LWP is the exception. This thing looks gorgeous. It has that bright, crisp "pop" that HD images have, and the entire thing is so customizable and runs SO smoothly. I've had fantastic battery life while using it and I could not be happier.   Only suggestions? More green/blue planets compared to red ones?
 - May 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.0&&&Real nice&&&Love it. I also agree that adding weather effects such as lightning would be awesome. Also this is a very minor complaint but the planets seem a little low poly. I know it can't be too high because it's for a cell phone but making the planet spheres smoother is just what it needs to make it perfect.
 - June 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.0&&&Visually Appealing&&&Lots of customization, fun, and beautiful graphics. This was the best spent two bucks I've spent in a long time.

 - May 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Sony Tablet S &&& 1.0&&&Fantastic&&&Have had the free galaxy wallpapers for a while. Hesitated to pay for a wallpaper but they looked so awesome I couldn't resist and you can tell some work has gone into this, so i'm very satisfied with the result.
 - May 17, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.0&&&Nice app&&&This is quite nice, colourful but would be great if there was a sun rise and corona that came from behind the planets.  Also a little more control over the planet surface would be nice.  Good app
 - May 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.0&&&Amazing&&&Great job on this pack..  updated galaxies pack and saw the link for this and instantly bought it... these are the only lwp's I ever use
 - May 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Dell Blaze &&& 1.0&&&Amazing as usual&&&There's no comparison to Maxelus LWPs, and this new planets pack proves it. Gorgeous planets, plenty of settings, not too hard on batteries... just great!
 - May 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.0&&&Why???&&&Why do you keep making such PHENOMINAL live wallpapers??? I'm trying to not spend my credit card, and yoy just keep coming at me with all this absolutely  amazing stuff ;) Keep it up :D

 - June 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Infuse 4G &&& 1.0&&&Excellent&&&When i first seen this live wallpaper i was unsure about. Once i purchased it and seen it actually running on my phone i was amazed. Good colors, very smooth and no lag. Buy it.
 - June 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.0&&&Another impeccable design from Maxelus!&&&Seriously, nobody does it better then this dev...he never disappoints :)I will buy anything of his w/out even seeing it! Excellent as usual my friend :)
 - May 30, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.0&&&Beautiful but laggy on my GNex&&&I will be buying again once it runs smooth on galaxy nexus. Love this and other LWP
 - May 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.0&&&Amazing!&&&Continues to be my favorite LWP dev. Was surprised to find this on the market as I checked yesterday and didn't see it. Looks great, runs smooth and has nice customization options. Love it!
 - May 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.0&&&Excellent&&&Once again.... incredible job.  Already a big fan of the galaxy pack, this is a welcome addition!  Droid bionic.
 - June 4, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.0&&&Also not working&&&No good on the Samsung S3. Just black screen... 3 stars because it looks good in principle.
 - June 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 1.0&&&Another awesome wallpaper&&&This developer is the best. Very high quality wallpapers and very customizable. I have this pack, galaxy pack, the free galaxy wallpapers, and the 3d aquarium wallpaper. All worth it!

 - May 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.0&&&Superb..&&&.. As usual.  I have to say I vastly prefer new earth to the others.. It would be out of this world if it was possible to have a blue version of it.. Maybe even choose the planets colour.
 - May 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.0&&&Stunning.  But one thing...&&&Another amazing live wallpaper.  I have the Galaxy Pack too.  But there's one thing that I don't like - the shadow effect seems to be made up of 'panels'.  As you scroll along, another panel appears or disappears.  It looks a bit graphically weird.  If you could fix that to make it look more circular and fade more smoothly, it would perfect.  I'm still rating 5 stars though, because this live wallpaper is stunning despite.
 - May 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.0&&&Just awesome!&&&I'm buying your LWP's sight unseen and haven't been disappointed yet!  Keep it up.  These are just awesome!
 - May 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.0&&&O.O&&&Makes designing live papers so easy and brilliant really.
 - May 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.0&&&Fantastic!&&&So many options and beautiful. Excellent just like all maxellus wallpapers. Would like the planet more fully lit and the atmosphere colors a little less bright, but still love it. Not a battery hog either
 - May 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0&&&Best evar&&&Hands down the best lwp ever! HD very smooth and crisp colours.   I love the custom options. Great work yet again. Had the galaxy pack as my wallpaper for ever.   Not any more

 - May 15, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0&&&Beautiful as always&&&Wallpapers like this make me grateful to God for granting me this device and for devs like you guys who create such amazing beauty. However the planets can occupy too much of the screen. It would be nice to have some zoom and angle customization
 - May 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.0&&&Awesome&&&Another great work. I am in your fan club.
 - May 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0&&&Wonderful!&&&Maxelus has done it again for sure. I'm loving this new lwp! Honestly don't think I dislike a single lwp from you guys. Keep up the fantastic job!
