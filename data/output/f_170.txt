 - May 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Incredible S &&& 1.0.9&&&Had to buy the full version!&&&Really loved the free one and I wanted all the extra features so I got the paid version! Runs super smooth, looks brilliant, nice preset themes and love being able to set custom colours too! It's Brilliant!
 - May 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 1.0.9&&&Update: now compatible&&&My bad, reFlashed my LG O2X (P990hN) with LWP option on. Now this excellent app works as well. Duh on me!

 - April 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.0.8&&&Nice Job&&&Works well and no noticeable phone lag.
 - April 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0.7&&&I really like this wallpaper&&&I have been using this wallpaper for a few months now and love it. I'm very happy that they now have the option to set multiple bubble colors. Since making this my wallpaper, I haven't used anything else.
 - April 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0.7&&&Easy on the eyes and tablet&&&I really like this live wallpaper.  It comes in a variety of color schemes as well as the ability to make your own custom colors. Combine this with the honeycomb clock pro widget (with multiple colors too) and you've got a very attractive homescreen that does not interfere or obstruct your icons.
 - April 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0.7&&&Clean&&&Nice wallpaper.
 - April 11, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.0.6&&&More themes&&&Pretty good but needs more themes though.  Theme names that intuitively reflect the colors would be nice too.
 - March 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy S Plus &&& 1.0.6&&&Brilliant!&&&It's amazing! Very smooth and nice! Strongly recommended :)
 - March 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.0.5&&&:)&&&Very nice with a smooth look! *SGS II*
 - February 27, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Defy &&& 1.0.4&&&Not SUpported&&&Hello, im using MIUI and this amazing is not compatible, can u guys solve this please
 - February 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.0.4&&&Amazing&&&Epic
 - January 24, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0.3&&&Great looking, but slows phone&&&This looks just as good (if not better) than the standard "Phase Beam" LWP that comes on the Galaxy Nexus.  Unfortunately, while the the stock Phase Beam wallpaper has no impact on performance, this wallpaper slows homescreen scrolling to the point that it's noticeable and annoying.  If they would release an update that fixes that I'll gladly give it 5 stars.  Running Verizon Galaxy Nexus, stock non-rooted.
 - December 19, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.0.2&&&Looks great, but...&&&It slows down scrolling on my Galaxy Nexus. The stock Phase Beam wallpaper has same effect and does not slow scrolling. I've tried adjusting settings...no go.  UPDATE 12/19: Things are running smoother now! Update helps with screen scrolling.
 - December 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.0.2&&&Perfect&&&It is pretty much perfect: looks awesome without being gaudy and runs efficiently.
 - December 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.0.2&&&Smooth&&&lwp, does not lag on my phone at all, great colors, best lwp out there.  htc inspire 4g
 - December 10, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0.1&&&Beautiful!!&&&Excellent options to customize! You can change the color according to your mood, hence the name! This gets me excited for ICS! GSII!
 - March 18, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&&&&&Looks Great But Looks are Deceiving&&&Whilst there's no getting away from it, the LWP is amazing to look at.  It's just a pity it causes monumental phone crashes whenever you put your phone to sleep and then try to revive it.  My nexus did not like it - and as such it's uninstalled.    NOT recommended.
 - January 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - HTC Desire HD&&&Nice !&&&Realy nice !
 - June 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - HTC Evo 4G&&&Love it&&&This is my permanent wallpaper now, I love everything about it plus it really has little to no noticeable effect on my battery.
