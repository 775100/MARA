 - April 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.0.2&&&Nice!&&&I love the smooth and colorful look of the wallpaper. The dino's look very cute. Perhaps the colors could change according to time of day and and and ... can I have a T-Rex? :) One small bug on galaxy A: in the app menu, you still hear the Dino sound on clicks.  Another small bug is that the Dino sound ignore the current profile, on silent you'll still hear it
