 - April 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 2.0&&&Worth the £1.25&&&You guys need to stop bitching about the ads and the mere cost of £1.25 to remove, its a great keyboard and to maintain its greatness it needs to be funded somehow. Ive tried loads and this one beats them all.
 - May 22, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 2.0&&&WTF&&&I enjoy using go keyboard, but now all the sudden theres adds that take up the top part of the screen, and you have to pay 6 for a dang plugin just to get rid of the ads!! the keyboard is gr8 but the rest sucks!
 - June 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 2.0&&&Best keyboard&&&Worth the small fee, stop moaning...
 - April 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - ZTE X500 &&& 2.0&&&proudly supporting&&&awww poor baby below had to pay for something, get off welfare and support good devs. paid with no refund cause im not a mooch
 - May 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 2.0&&&The best keyboard ever.&&&I own slideit and swiftkey,  bought them when they were 10 cents, this keyboard is worth every cent out of the 6 dollars I paid for, it is by far the better keyboard out of the lot. Word correction works flawlessly for me. Thank you so much for this great product.
 - May 10, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 2.0&&&A bit expensive...&&&When compared to other keyboards. The only reason I use this keyboard in particular is the ability to turn off the dictionary & word prediction.
 - April 25, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 2.0&&&No longer free which sucks !&&&I bought the app just so I can voice my opinion. The ads totally suck. It's all down to greed, as it was once free now developers want to try and make easy money. Now I've voiced my opinion, I'm going straight for a refund and removing this ad funded crap from my phone. I advise others do the same.
 - June 21, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 2.0&&&Save your money&&&This app doesnt work at all. Do not purchase.
 - May 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 2.0&&&Seems to work&&&It took me forever to figure out that Go keyboard caused the air push ads. Would've been nice to be notified. More than happy to pay for a good product, so notification of it no longer being free would've been cool.
 - May 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 2.0&&&GO KEYBOARD REMOVE ADS&&&I download and use all of your different keyboard skins.  Having to pay the very small amount for this application to remove ads seems extremely reasonable to me.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy getting whatever I can for free.  However, I understand that in order for the continuance of these wonderful applications, the developer(s) may be put in a position of having to charge something for their work.  Thanks and keep up the good work.  I love your applications.
 - April 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 2.0&&&GO! Forth and Type&&&An already wonderful keyboard made better by removing the ads. (Not that the ads were at all intrusive to begin with.) Plenty of themes and plugins to enhance your experience and thanks to a recent update, it works. Go full version and support!
 - April 26, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 2.0&&&Still have ads...&&&I paid your stinking two bucks but I still have f-ing ads in my way. If this is the direction go is going you will lose followers quickly.
 - April 28, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 2.0&&&Annoying&&&A great keyboard but the Go Market updates are really annoying and do not belong in a paid application.
 - June 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.0&&&it's worth the price&&&Simply put, I think it is ridiculous to expect good things like this to always remain free.  If a developer can't make money off of something, then why do it?  So if you like an app, support it already!  Otherwise, you won't see improvements, you won't see bug fixes, and you won't see new apps.  That's not about greed, people, it's about making the development process worthwhile.  Yeah, they could've gone about it a better way but I do understand their side here.
 - May 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 2.0&&&Buy it you whiney babies&&&I bought this and it will stay bought.  Best kbrd ever.   All you crybabies who want it free - for the price of a mixed drink you own it forever. Anyhow, when did you ever offer something of value for so little?   Enjoy your welfare cheque.
 - April 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 2.0&&&Good&&&Why don't y'all bring back the android icon, I use them alot
 - July 1, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 2.0&&&Great app, glad to support it&&&People who complain about the cost:  these guys can't work for free.  Snap out of it, you selfish children.  This is a great app  and I'm glad to pay for it.  Plus I hate ads, lol.
 - June 30, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.0&&&Frank&&&Buy the application to support dev.  Keep up the improvement
 - June 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.0&&&It's a great keyboard&&&Well worth it. I bought it support the developer because it's a great keyboard.
 - May 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 2.0&&&Exceeded my expectations&&&Swype keyboard style with an enter key for new lines.  Easy. Also Has great cursor control. Prediction could be slightly better.
 - April 26, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Incredible S &&& 2.0&&&Great keyboard!&&&To be honest, the ad update had me kinda relieved. I mean, at least now GOs business model is known. The way Android handles keyboards necessitates a great deal of trust in the publisher. This isnt a lone kindhearted hobbyist or Google. This is a company that needs to pay its workers. The price is fair for a polished multilingual product (and lower than the competitors) and the ads on the free version even are unintrusive.

 - April 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 2.0&&&Dear Craig&&&you sir are an idiot. you apparently expect everything in life for free. these peoplework their ***es off making this software and you are to cheap to spend two bucks. let me guess. wherever you work you work for free right?
 - April 28, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X2 &&& 2.0&&&Shafted!&&&(_))#D (_(_]   by a little japaneese man.....

 - June 5, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 2.0&&&Poor strategy&&&I'd rather have a donate version with some unique themes then a pesky forced "add update" and a rip-off 4 euro, so much for a descent free software developer...
 - June 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 2.0&&&great&&&love this keyboard

 - April 26, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 2.0&&&Stupid app&&&Started displaying ads. Now you gotta pay to remove that shit. Developers not improving the app but wanna change. Damn them.
 - April 30, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 2.0&&&I do buy it but I hate it from free to paid.&&&Not a good move!  If plan charging then shall earlier already charge, not from the middle.

 - April 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.0&&&As a 1st Reviewer I Expect More&&&Ok.. I have purchased your ads removal plugin, but I want more than that. Please, add undo/redo feature.
 - April 23, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Infuse 4G &&& 1.0&&&You screwed up&&&You screw up your keyboard by adding ads. I purchase the ad removal for $1.99 and the keyboard will no longer work on my phone. I want a refund. But conveniently there is no refund button. Fix it so I can get my money back.
 - April 23, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.0&&&??? ???????&&&? ?????? ????, ??? ??'? ??? ???????? ??? ????. ???!
 - April 26, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Droid Bionic&&&1.99 to remove ads?!!&&&Youve got to be kidding me. What a blatant example of greed.  You offer the app for free from the start, and then in the most recent update, after youve gotten a nice user base and popularity,you bend everyone over and shove your fist up their behind, and beg for $2.00. Sorry losers, Im uninstalling and getting my refund!
 - June 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - LG Cayman&&&Awesome!&&&Freaking awesome!  Man I love your Go keyboard this thing is awesome! If you can improve the swype (it's not picking my words) and make a free Tron legacy theme and a theme copy of my swype keyboard from Android version 2.3.6 swype version 3.2.6 it will be perfect! I went ahead and bought your remove ads application cause it's so freaking awesome and FAST! I love it keep up the great work man! Y'all RULE!  Thanks,  Alex
