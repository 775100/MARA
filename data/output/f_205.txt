 - April 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.6.2m&&&Best VPN out but......&&&love this app, use it everyday multiple times, upgraded to android 4 today and now it doesn't work, hopefully you can fix this soon!
 - November 17, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.6.2m&&&Works great.&&&Works great on my Droid X connecting to Windows Server PPTP. The widget saves a lot of time. Hoping for Honeycomb support for my tablet in the future.
 - June 2, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Galaxy S2 Skyrocket &&& 1.6.2m&&&Even our CTO couldn't get it to log in&&&We don't have a complex network at the office but after an hour of fiddling and trying every suggested trick, couldn't make a connection.  When we manually connect (via the really stupid native Android way) 1VPN recognized the connection and the icon glowed and we could disconnect from the icon, but no way to 1-touch connect.
 - August 30, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.6.2m&&&TRY THE 48HR TRAIL FROM THEIR SITE FIRST&&&Worth the price. Works well, saves a lot of time. 1-click widget connect is great! Needs notification icon if DCed - SGS2
 - March 11, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.6.2m&&&Awesome app&&&I really hope to see an update compatible with ice cream sandwich soon.
 - September 16, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.6.2m&&&Simply amazing!&&&So awesome to use! Can you add an option for larger widget that has clickable list of servers? That would be like 5*x10! L2TP works on 2.3 DROIDX
 - September 24, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.6.2m&&&Very comfortable&&&Does exactly what it said, if the export backup could be encrypted worth 5 star.
 - June 22, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.6.2m&&&Bought this app, but meanwhile it's incompatible !&&&I bought this app some while ago for my Samsung Galaxy S2. Want to re-install it now but it is now stated that : "this app is incompatible with your Samsung GT-I9100 !!!  What the hell happend ? It worked great before !!
 - November 13, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.6.2m&&&Great App&&&Is there a plan to make 1 VPN tablet compatible?  I would love to use it on my Transformer.
 - May 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.6.2m&&&Ics&&&Damnit!! When u gonna support ics? I'm really in need :(
 - April 2, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.6.2m&&&What happened!?&&&This app was working fine for me, now its acting up! I can't to vpn with it anymore!
 - February 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid 3 &&& 1.6.2m&&&Huge time saver&&&Connecting to a VPN in android can be painful - up to 5 clicks!  This app lets you add a widget for one click toggling of the VPN connection.
 - April 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.6.2m&&&stopped working after upgrade to Android 4&&&This worked fine until I upgraded to Android 4 on HTC sensation.  I'd buy an updated version which worked with Android 4.0.  DOANDROIDS: any idea when?
 - September 29, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.6.2m&&&Useful utility, Widget should be configurable&&&Nice app, does what it claims. In my mind the Widget is what makes it 1 click, however it appears that you can only use it for the first VPN setup. All additional widgets open the same VPN. Other than that, it's a little pricey.
 - April 28, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.6.2m&&&It's doesn't keeping setting&&&I like it first  But then I need each time to enter agien the setting  I don't know why it's deleting from the app  It doesn't save the setting for me Useless
 - June 11, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Incredible S &&& 1.6.2m&&&Fix the l2tp please&&&The app should be included in the OS. One step VPN connection is really important. Please support l2tp with pre shared key. I don't see how this is so hard with what you've got. Also please add connect on boot.
 - April 29, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.6.2m&&&Wast of money&&&After upgraded to ICS, this app is not supported any more!
 - June 17, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Tab &&& 1.6.2m&&&Buggy&&&Nice, but no support for L2PT PSK and always opens the Android VPN dialogue when using the widget, which is annoying.
 - May 29, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Casio G'zOne Commando &&& 1.6.2m&&&Great app, worth the price if you use VPNs a lot&&&I have 13 VPNs that I support for my employer. This app pays for itself with the time saved by not having to enter passwords. The problems that I've had appear to be related to Android or maybe my Casio Commando. I spent a frustrating couple of hours trying to get it to connect to 3 of the VPNs, which are configured the same as the other 10. I could connect to all 13 with a PC with no problem. I finally gave up for the day. When I tried them the next day all 3 connected on the first try with no changes.
 - May 5, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Tab &&& 1.6.2m&&&Licence check fails so useless now&&&I bought it fair and square and now it has decided to fail a licence check and refuse to work. It is demanding that I pay them again so I can use it - disgusting behaviour.
 - September 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 1.6.2m&&&Great with Witopia&&&I was doubtful this could be worth it but I now won't be without it. It's not necessary but it sure does speed getting to witopia's vpn.
 - February 20, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.6.2m&&&Great App, Great Support&&&When I initially installed the app on my Samsung Charge, it wouldn't work.  I emailed the developer and got an answer within the hour.  All it took was to go to the preferences and check the box "Fix for Galaxy devices".  Now it works great.  Maybe I missed the fix for this issue being posted on the site.  Do wish it would support the more secure L2TP with shared secret, but I understand that may be a limitation created by Android.   Overall a great app and would recommend it.
 - August 2, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.6.2m&&&Extremely useful, with a very responsive dev&&&When I downloaded the app, it first failed to work on my Vibrant (running CM7, Trigger Redux). I emailed the dev and got a friendly reply within less than 15 minutes (!!!). They then walked me through installing a client for sending some debug info, and once I sent the info, resolved my issue in a single email. A fantastic app with a super-responsive dev -- the perfect combination. Highly recommended!
 - November 14, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Defy &&& 1.6.2m&&&Fast, simple effective tool&&&Lets me connect to office vpn to check mail easily.Well worth the price for the time it saves
 - December 17, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Tab &&& 1.6.2m&&&Perfect VPN Application&&&I really does not have much to add. This nice app works perfectly on my Android 7" Galaxy Tab P-1000. However there is a few things one need to know for getting VPN to work good. The app's "default" of using PPTP is not the best choice. But if you know server addresses for L2TP choose that instead. For me PPTP resulted in unstable connections. This is not the app's fault at all, but can easily be blamed for it if you don't know. PPTP is the least secure of the two protocols (PPTP and L2TP) supported by Android.  PPTP: A very basic VPN protocol based on PPP. PPTP was the first VPN protocol supported on the Microsoft Windows platform. The PPTP specification does not actually describe encryption or authentication features and relies on the PPP protocol being tunneled to implement security functionality. Due to the major security flaws, there is no good reason to choose PPTP other than device compatibility. If you have a device on which L2TP is supported then it may be a better choice.  L2TP: An advanced protocol formally standardized in IETF RFC 3193 and now the recommended replacement for PPTP where secure data encryption is required. L2TP is the best choice for Android.  5 stars :)
