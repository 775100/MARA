 - April 26, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1&&&DONT BUY if you are running ICS!&&&I just bought this app for my Asus Transformer 1st Gen running ICS. It opens but just sets at the loading screen and never does anything else. I can not go to any options or do anything! I tried this a different phone running ICS and it does the same thing. Please update and fix this. $10 is a lot to ask for an app. It also did not give me an option for a refund. This is suppose to be a great app. I just wish I could use it.

 - June 7, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1&&&Hoping For Support - No Response From Vendor&&&I am excited about what I can do with this $10 app (very pricey it seems) but it just hangs in Loading mode when I try to run it.  I am running ICS 4.03 on android tablet.  Have been waiting to hear from the vendor about upgrading for ICS 4.03 and why the app says it will work on my tablet, but does not.

 - April 9, 2011&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0&&&Great app, Poor optimization for smaller screens&&&I have a HTC Wildfire with a 3.2" screen and it was disappointing that this app gets clipped terribly and does not fit correctly on the screen. Such a pity for an app that seems like quite a gem and had to return it to the store.
