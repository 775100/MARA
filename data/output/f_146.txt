 - June 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.9.5&&&Superb for small screens / big thumbs&&&I came to this looking for something to make a cheap Android phone foolproof for an elderly relative. However I paid for the full version for my Xperia Ray. It's made a solid difference to it's usability - the interface is far more fluent and manageable than the mess of home screens, widgets and shortcuts I had before.Totally echo the sentiments of other users; *don't* be fooled by it's apparently basic nature, this is a very well thought out app. I'd like to see the same developers apply themselves to some of the other stock applications. REQUEST: I'd like to see some sort of widget support on the home / second screen.
 - May 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.9.5&&&Great app for legally blind&&&I'm legally, but not totally blind; as such, it was difficult to see the launcher icons, or worse, things on the applications menu if I had to use it.  This app is stinkin' awesome - Very big fonts, bright icons (I use the dark theme, easiest for me to see), and very customizable. Loses 1/4 star only because the phone dial pad isn't altered (though contacts and recent calls are) so dialing a number manually is still very difficult for me.  All in all _definitely_ worth what little they're asking for it, heck, my cup of coffee this morning cost 3x that...

 - May 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.9.5&&&Do not take this for a baby's app;&&&A streamlined user interface helped me be more productive with my phone. Before I had widgets, home screens and just mess.
 - May 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 1.9.5&&&Truly great app&&&Keep up the good work
 - July 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.9.5&&&Great App!&&&Useful for hubby with big hands who gets frustrated with little buttons.  Appears on the surface to be a simple app, but it is extremely well thought out and allows the user to access all of the phone's features.  Very user friendly.  Thanks for making a user friendly, feature-packed app that works without flaw, all at a great price.
 - July 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.9.5&&&Love it!&&&Big and simple. Love it! Need HD icons for my Note. Perhaps customizable icons in future?
 - April 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 1.9&&&Functional & Attractive!&&&Finally, I can take off my reading glasses! I don't pay for many apps, but after using the free version for, like, 10-minutes, I paid for this full version. Thanks for thinking of us over-40 users!
 - April 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 1.9&&&Great App&&&Let me start by saying that my vision is excellent. I'm just sick of apps that think 8 point font is appropriate. I can't wait 'til all of these app developers hit their 40s. This is a terrific app, no more struggling to see what I'm doing.  I Love the new multiple-pages. Next version suggestion: ability to filter by frequent contacts in the phone part. Then, when you get some free time:  Big Mail Client; Big RSS Reader.  Keep coding, I'll keep buying.
 - April 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy Precedent &&& 1.9&&&Great app&&&I can now use my phone without having to use my glasses. This is a must have app for anyone. Design and buttons are large enough to help you see and use your phone.
 - April 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 1.9&&&Perfect&&&This launcher is the only way my mom could switch to a smart phone. Very well thought out. I only ask that future versions allow expandable apps that can be scrolled downward on the home page
 - April 5, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.8&&&good app but........&&&good app but when when you turn  the homescreen on after the phones in standby mode for awhile it goes to the last app you used instead of just the home screen.
 - April 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Droid Charge &&& 1.8&&&Great app&&&Works great on droid charge... a must have app for seniors
 - March 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.8&&&Fun. Don't need it, but bought it.&&&Possibly add option to have multiple home screens or allow single home screen to scroll vertically.
 - April 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G &&& 1.8&&&Awsome&&&Made this smart phone dumb enough for my mom awsome buy for helping out parents who cant grasp technology
 - April 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.8&&&A godsend for visually impaired people&&&I have low vision (I see about 20/200 with corrective lenses on) and so smartphones were very hard for me to use because I couldn't read the text on the screen without a magnifying glass.   BIG Launcher has been a great app for me. It makes it very easy to do the most important basic functions that you do all the time -- looking people up in your contacts so you can call or text them, reading text messages, and launching apps. The app is customizable so that you can adjust it pretty easily to suit your specific needs. The three different text sizes will make it easy to use for people with a variety of vision issues.  Sure, this app does not do everything. But it covers most of the basic functions you use all the time. Everyone will come up with their own wish list for features to add, and I hope the developers are not too overwhelmed by it all. If you look at the revision history, though, you can see that they have added a huge number of features over the last few months. So hopefully the capabilities of BIG Launcher will continue to expand.  In short, BIG Launcher is a great app for making phones easier to use for the visually impaired.

Also, it is not showing compatibility with the Sony X10 Mini, which is my father's phone. Any incompatibility with custom ROMs?

I got it for my wife ;-) If I could pick different icons and apps it would be a 5star plus app. I set up the gallery app to be the calendar, would be nice if I could change the icon. Also I don't really need the camera app, so being able to change the app on more than just the gallery button would be awesome.
 - June 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Samsung Galaxy S3&&&Good for the non-technical user too!&&&My wife of a techno-phobic. With big button launcher (and a T3 keyboard!) I was able to get her to lose the Nokia and use my old Desire so I could get my new Galaxy S3.
