 - March 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid II &&& 1.1.2&&&Very nice!&&&Tranquil.  I like the day/night feature and being able to do both auto and manual settings for the change; I like the shooting stars and lights. Images are just as advertised, and there is a free version to try first so no risk.  A+!
 - March 9, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.2&&&WTF!!!!!!&&&It looks NOTHING like the screenshots!!!!!!!!!!! Uninstalled & refunded.What's wrong with you photoshoping your screenshots just to make some quick cash,SHAME ON YOU!!! And for all you idiots giving this great reviews need to get your eyes checked because this looks nothing like the pictures above.I'm reporting you to Google.
 - April 3, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.1.2&&&Rip off!!!! Violating Google terms!!!!&&&Rip off!!!! Not nearly as high def a wallpaper as your pics make it look! Might get a couple more stars if you're at least honest. Animation is horrible, and background isn't realistic at all. Also, did not allow refund when requested immediately!!!! Total rip off, should NOT be allowed on Google store because you are NOT following refund guidelines, the 15 min window!!!!!
 - May 21, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.2&&&Nice but the water anim is too low res!&&&In general its a nice idea, but i'm not excited about the water, its lo-resolution makes it not believable. the pic of water in the free version was better than the paid "moving" version. please make it HD and it will be a 5star wallpaper
 - May 4, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.1.2&&&Terrible!!!&&&The water animation is just awful & my phone constantly freezes up since I downloaded this app.  I'm uninstalling it now.  Dont waste your money!!!
