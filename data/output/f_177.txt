 - May 4, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0&&&Why are there ads and no full screen capability?&&&Sorry.  I know it was only. 99 but if I knew it had ads and that I would have to look at two bright red task bars (top and bottom), I would not have purchased it.  I love Spurgeon but I can't believe how cheesy this presentation of his classic work really is.  I hope it gets fixed soon.
