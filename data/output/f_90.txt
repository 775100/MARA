 - April 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 1.0.4&&&The best&&&Without a doubt the best skylanders app in the market. Just missing a few of the new figures ie pearl hex, the clear figures and the glow in the dark figures.

 - April 17, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0.3&&&Only slightly disappointed&&&Spent the 99 cents. The app is built very well. However, there are released characters that are missing information and character pictures.
 - April 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.0.1&&&Worth the money!&&&Sure there are free Skylander apps out there but there are thrown together and rough looking.  This one is well worth paying for.
