 - July 1, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4&&&Good but could be great&&&Switching on never seems to work first time with tap and drag. Really need to disable the function during a call - constant vibrations and the phone is switched off. Have had to disable the app until this is resolved
 - May 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.4&&&Perfect&&&I have tried all possible programs. This one works perfectly for turning the screen on and off. Also didn't have any accidental on-offs. If the power button is annoying you somehow, this definitely is the way to go. I would be happy to see a screen off widget included as well.
 - June 25, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 1.4&&&HTC ONE X&&&Pretty good but could be better. Only downs is it messes with the auto brightness and has a little bit of lock screen lag.
 - June 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4&&&Excellent app!&&&No battery drainage, wave function works well in my pocket, tap & vibrate.. Not to my liking. Definitely worth it! Support him guys!
 - June 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4&&&Finally...&&&Works great on my phone. At last, a complete app that can switch on and off the screen. Save my the one and only power button! Wave method is a bit annoy on my phone but tap method never fails me. Phone can enter deep sleep mode and it will be perfect if some settings can be shown i.e. the sensor timeout interval.
 - June 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 1.4&&&Brlliant on One X&&&After a little bit of tweaking my  One X now wakes up with a natural wave. One problem, I'm not getting any work done as I'm constantly messing with ny phone now. Highly recommended. My phone is unrooted and unmodified in any way.
 - June 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4&&&Amazing App, terrible forums for discussing it&&&No matter what I cannot participate on the forums. I cannot post or respond to anything on any of the forums. So I've given up there. I almost uninstalled and asked for a refund because of the frustration dealing with the XDA forums.  With that said, this app is amazing and works well even with my lock screen. Now I have to train myself not to push the power button
 - July 1, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.4&&&Awesome&&&Awesome app that I needed to support! But now when turning on, it shows the screen completely dim and then turns right off. Please fix!!!!!!
 - June 24, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4&&&Can be better&&&Disabling the sensor during phone calls is a must.
 - June 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4&&&very cool.&&&Can you make it so one wave turns on and two waves turns off..?
 - June 14, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.4&&&Innovative!&&&Nice app! It works great with the sensor. Doesn't seem to affect battery. Only problem is now my lock screen is now disabled. While great, I need the security of it.
 - June 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.4&&&Droid Rzr XT910&&&Exactly what i was looking for....saves my power button a lot..
 - June 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4&&&Flawlessly&&&I am using Galaxy S II, the both +WAVE MODE and +TAP AND SWIPE MODE worked PERFECTLY!!:D  !! Have no regret for buying the pro version, the best app I have ever purchased yet. PS: rated 5 stars to your app.
 - June 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4&&&Hands down Awesomeness!&&&Get this app, you won't regret it. Responsive and saves your phone buttons
 - May 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.4&&&Droid RAZR&&&Awesome app! Took a little tweaking,  but Love that I can turn on just by waving my finger. Long live my power button!
 - May 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4&&&Love it! Again&&&Great app I hope you work on this relentlessly to draw the least amount of power possible. I also hope we don't get charged for another app similar to this
 - May 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4&&&Awesome&&&This is so cool!
 - June 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4&&&Excellent on GSM Galaxy Nexus&&&Works perfectly.
 - June 28, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4&&&touch and on!&&&works great on samsung galaxy tab 7.7 except when lock screen is on where it goes on and off. configured to touch proximity sensor and turned off lock screen, worked great.
 - June 27, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.4&&&Mostly good&&&Turns the screen ON very well, the feature to turn the screen OFF doesn't seem to work so well... I'd give this 5 stars if I could get that feature to work. Otherwise great app.
 - May 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.3&&&Great&&&I was putting much wear on power button to wake phone up. This solved the problem
 - May 16, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3&&&Buggy.&&&Great concept but the few nagging bugs are just too much. Hopefully dev continues to work on ironing out these minor bugs.
 - May 14, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.2&&&Sleep issue&&&Is there anyway it can retain the automatic sleep off? My phone now stays awake now unless I manually sleep it. Overall a great app. Can show friends that I am a Jedi lol.
 - May 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.2&&&Good work!&&&Fixed awesome.
 - May 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.2&&&Genius! ! !&&&
 - May 15, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.2&&&A few bugs&&&Love the idea of this and when it works its great, however I do get FCs every so often
 - June 23, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Samsung Galaxy Note&&&AT&T Galaxy Note&&&Does not work on my Galaxy Note. Keeps cycling on and off. Emailed developer. No response. Soon as finger passes sensor, goes back to sleep.
 - May 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Dell Streak&&&Excellent&&&Excellent
