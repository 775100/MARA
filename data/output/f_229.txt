 - May 31, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 4.5.9.6&&&Great file search&&&Pls update some good file icons; or if we can add own icons would be nice; other than that everything great.
 - June 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 4.5.6.2&&&All i needed&&&Thank you developer. With this app i managed to control my files and extract protected 7z archives as well as creating them. Its worth mentioning that the compression ratio for the archives i tested was slightly better than the original 7zip on windows. Great application and the update made it better. What I love about the support is that I emailed the developer before I sleep and woke up to find a reply to my email and an update ready solving my issue. Very responsive support.
 - March 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 4.0.2.2&&&Best around&&&Better than Astro just because u can multi-select results from search & then copy, cut, etc. V.4 is even better...nice improvements. Can't backup.

 - January 31, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 3.0.4.6&&&New Version 31 January&&&Its functionality is excellent, but It's no faster on my stock Sensation than the previous version. It lost all my shortcuts when I upgraded. The LONG press that allowed you (I think!) to add folder as a shortcut has disappeared. Can't seem to customise the order of items on the lower tool bar. Disappointing!
