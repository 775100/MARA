 - July 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Admire &&& 1.5&&&Admire&&&I would give it the five star but it looks horrible having the big grey gap in the screen..fix & i'll five star it...
 - April 29, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.4&&&another thing&&&will rate 5 stars if you make the battery charger like the iphone
 - March 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3&&&Nice&&&Let the message bar and call bar show who its from. Choose whether you can see what the message says or not.
 - March 17, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.2&&&No custom app option&&&This is a great locker, however, it really needs to be able to select which apps it unlocks. The native sms and mail suck on HTC phones. Would like it to open go sms or handcent instead. I will definately re install if this happens.
 - March 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 1.2&&&Awesome feel!&&&I use this as a daily locker now. It feels so responsive. I believe this is the best locker app on the market. A lot of them have the look but still lack something. This one is grade A perfect! I'm not a fan of the iphone-esq look but I do appreciate its appeasement for android devices! Great job!!!
 - February 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.1&&&Perfect!&&&Works perfect. Message notification shows and goes directly to Handcent as desired. Wallpaper can be customized to one in my gallery which is also perfect. Epic 4G Touch n works great.
 - March 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1&&&Brilliant!&&&I love this! The only thing's missing are the battery level percentage while it's charging. Also is there anyway you can make the slider icons green like on the iPhone? That would be great if you could :)
 - February 16, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.0&&&Htc evo 4g&&&Well this would be a terrific lock screen app if you would let the messages popup in the notification bar then it'll feel just like iphone or maybe better and let the slide go into the message app not stock sms and like Facebook and twitter other notifocations
 - February 9, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.0&&&Good.&&&Wish it could show unread Gmail and email and you could change the wallpaper. The wallpaper is ugly. SMS notification doesn't go to GOSMS app. Disappointed.
