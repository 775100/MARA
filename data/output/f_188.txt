 - June 27, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.5.0&&&No search tool?&&&Latest version looks slicker but I just don't like having to navigate the hierarchies and remember where each entry is.  My brain is confused seeing a general heading like "Crime" at the same level in the menu structure as the very specific "Licensing Act 2003", and "People" (don't all offences involve people somehow?).  The app forces you to understand the logic of the designer, rather than the designer making the categories intuitive and simple.  IMHO it really needs a rethink and a SEARCH tool like "Quick Reference for UK Police".  On the plus side there's plenty of detailed content (full legal wording) but sometimes a quick summary would be nicer for those of us who don't speak "Legal" :)

 - May 31, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Neo &&& 2.0.2&&&Vastly improved!&&&Update: after using this for several months, I'd found two major flaws. 1. App is too large, taking up valuable phone storage space. 2. App took too long to load. However, the latest update fixes both! Size is MUCH better and it's much faster to load, so upgraded to a 4-star review. Could do with the capacity to change font size (for older users!) and also the general design and display could be a bit snazzier, but still. It WORKS! Good job :)

 - May 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Ace &&& 1.3&&&Really handy&&&I find this app very handy, it's not something i use daily but it's invaluable when i do need it.  The info on here is a bit basic, and it's a bit cut-and-paste from legislation, but as long as you remember that it's not a definitive list of all offences and just a pocket guide you won't be dissappointed.
 - May 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.3&&&Excellent value&&&Really good app. The menu and ordering of information could do with a bit if work, but otherwise very thorough and informative. Dev, any chance you could add a section regarding the Public Service Vehicles Regulations 1990?

 - February 18, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire S &&& 1&&&Good app&&&It's a very good app  and useful, the only thing at the min is if you could zoom in on the text or it as a bit bigger would be great
