 - July 2, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.7.4&&&Excellent&&&This dictionary is extensive, and indicates pronounciation both phonetically and, for most words, with recorded native speakers. Definitions are more extensive than in the smaller dictionaries. The user can select a word in a definition and click on it to get its translation in the reverse direction. Flash cards can be downloaded with the dicttionary at no extra charge. Seems to be similar, if not identical, to the Merriam-Webster offering, which is priced higher.
