 - March 3, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G Slide &&& 1.16&&&Misled&&&I feel completely mislead. There is a screenshot at the top that shows a countdown with seconds, milliseconds and so forth. That is what I was expecting to be able to put on my home screen. That is what would have been worth a buck. UPSET! To say the least
 - February 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.16&&&Simple and brilliant&&&Applies the Kiss principle and has good widgets.
 - June 26, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.16&&&No 4x1 widget&&&I upgraded my phone from a galaxy s2 to a s3 now the 4x1 widget is not there. Is this a android 4.0 issue?
 - November 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.16&&&Exactly what I needed!&&&Simple, easy, and works great! So far, this is the only countdown widget I've found that actually allows you set the end TIME, not just date! Loving the extra themes, definitely worth the $1 for the pro version. Thank you!
 - March 5, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.16&&&Needs work.&&&Will add a star for each fix. 1.  Widget stops unexpectedly. 2.  Needs milliseconds counter. 3.  Ability to fully customize backround colors.  What's the point if it only runs in the backround?
 - May 21, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 1.16&&&Count Up bug&&&Widget jumps to 47,000+ days every now and then. Also custom colors would help for legibility.

 - November 10, 2011&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.16&&&Updated - Does what it says it does.&&&Updating my previous comment.  About a week later, I was contacted by the Author (thank you) and he explained the application and the lack of refund (understandable) but the scrolling seems to be odd.  Scrolling up or down ANYWHERE on the screen (incl. flicking) moved the whole screen and NOT the time wheels. If you tried it, still only moved very very little AND the whole screen still moved up and down. I had to swipe left or right on the scrolling wheel to get any noticeable movement. Just my experience.
 - June 19, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.16&&&4x1 widget doesn't work.&&&Love the 2x1 widget, but the 4x1 doesn't work (ICS Nexus S with Nova Launcher) and the small one is a little too small to read easily.
 - April 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.16&&&Great counter&&&Very useful for me. Would like to see time zone specific events. ie. I'm on the east coast, but vegas wsop is in diffrent timezone. So all i can do is put in event starts at noon. But noon east coast time is 2 to 3 hrs difference (+/- daylight savings)
