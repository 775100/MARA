 - April 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Shooter &&& 2.3.1&&&Awesome on HTC EVO 3D;) Hold it Right Get it Right&&&Super Accurate once calibrated correctly.  Great App and a Definite Recommendation for Measuring Stuff.  Will be most useful for measuring area of a house, etc in Real Estate or other basic measurements.  If you are patient enough in the initial setup of the app trust me, you are gonna have a ball. This app should not go to waste.  For some reason with the calibration set at 75% I get very accurate results.(have requested developer who is really quick in responding to update the calibration in future) The phone height is at its default 4.9 and I hold the phone between chin and collar bone level(I am 5'5") I used the tile flooring(1x1 foot tiles) in my house as a marker to calibrate the phone to get the accuracy for the length and width right and the rest is history.  You could use a predefined area with a measuring tape as your marker with marker points at each foot/meter for calibration part and calibrate your phone and check accuracy and remember the settings (in case someone fidgets with it) so later you can be at ease that you have a pretty accurate app when you need anything to be measured in the course of your daily living. Cheers Sorry for the Long Post but hope it's helpful

 - May 5, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 2.2.3&&&Xoom works great&&&Ver 2.1.1 now works well on the Xoom tablet. Hint: prepare a string with a loop at each end of a reasonable length. Loop one end around your tablet or phone and the other around your shoe to maintain a known fixed height. Carefully measure the distance from the camera lens to the ground and enter this measurement into the app. Your results will be much more accurate and consistant. The result will only be accurate if performed on reasonably level ground. Great app!
