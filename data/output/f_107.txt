June 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid 3 &&& 3.1.8&&&More info than I could learn in two lifetimes.&&&Well worth the $4,a 'must have' for any player.To respond to other comments I'd say 1,go to settings and have your screen not time out,2,metronome and tuner apps are free and very reliable,look em up.I'd like to see a app with guitar licks,that'd be every bit as useful as this one,wish I knew how to write code.One thing I'd like to see on this app would be a arpeggio finder like the chord finder,e.g. tap in notes for a arpeggio then have the app tell me which one I'm playing.
 - June 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.1.8&&&Great&&&Great app,but after saving say your chords on all chords you should be able to import to gtrs ref,only logical,have to start again.and why,have you wasted half the screen? All chds layout better,may have to update.

This is sooo needed! 2. sound for chords and scales! How come there's none? 3. a good metronome (one you can play with screen off so the battery doesn't melt when you just need a metronome)... 4. a less tedious way to find a specific chord, I wish it was more user friendly.  That's some BIG flows but this app is good nonetheless, however it's more for advanced users than for beginners.
