 - June 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 2.0.3&&&Works great and top notch support&&&I needed a reliable FTP client to use on my tablet to send backup copies of pics from my DSLR's SD card to a home based FTP server so that I always have backups even if a card is lost or stolen. This worked perfectly for updating daily. A recent update initially took away the ability to select all during my upload process but I got in touch with support and they responded with a fix quickly. I am extremely pleased with this and recommend it over other FTP clients because I tested quite a few before buying this!
 - May 5, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X2 &&& 1.7.3&&&Amazing app some exceptions&&&null error upon completion of files seems only files 100mb+ have this error. Have to double check file size to make sure the transfer really finished. 90% of the time no probs, the rest i have to try the transfer again. Otherwise this would get 5 stars
 - April 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.7.3&&&Fantastic FTP App&&&Very easy to use with a great user interface, this FTP app allows me to connect to all the servers I need access to for maintaining various websites. Also have a FileZilla FTP server running on my home PC, and can now easily access all my files from my Android device no matter where I am. Be your own cloud! Highly recommended!
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.7.3&&&Loving this app so far!&&&Unlike the first ftp client I tried (AndFTP), this one was easy to set up with my server and it works perfectly! Just went in and deleted a bunch of eBay pix from my server, no need to wait until I get home! Next I suppose I might consider using a little of my server space for a small personal cloud.  Well worth paying for, and thanks to the developers for a paid no-ads version!

 - March 12, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.7.1&&&Good App With One Issue I Cannot Fix&&&Works great for FTP and SFTP with password authentication but cannot get it to work with the private key that I do use in ConnectBot to SSH to my home servers. The public and private keys work fine in ConnectBot but if I past the private key from Connectbot into a text file and then point FTPcafe Pro to use it authentication always fails.  Have emailed developer who said he would investigate when he gets back from vacation, as soon as he or anyone else can give me a fix, then will revise this review to 5 stars.
