 - June 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.3.1&&&Seldom miss any notifications ever since...&&&It works as intended that I have become busier ever since I had this app installed.
 - July 1, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.3.1&&&Nice notification app&&&Good app. Would like an option to enable clicking the widget to open the monitored apps when there are no notifications present. Would make the widget a better experience
 - June 22, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.3.1&&&No refund&&&Uninstalled in less than 15 mins but didn't give a refund.
 - June 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.3.1&&&Works great!!&&&I use it along with: TeslaUnread LightFlow NotifierPro Plus & StatusBar+ Can't live without it!
 - June 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.3.1&&&Nova launcher&&&Lets me have notification badges like my iphone had with nova launcher
 - June 20, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.3.1&&&Cool idea but flawed&&&I liked this app at first but started noticing flaws like having to completely reboot my phone in order to clear call log.  Notifications come in properly for most elements, and all clear after checking, except for call history.  I have tried actually calling the missed number back, clearing it from call log history.  Only way to clear a missed call notification is to reboot my phone.  Kind of renders the app entirely useless.
 - July 1, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.3.1&&&Good app, serious flaw&&&I love the functionality but the fact that it says "the folder is open" even I click on a folder is horribly annoying. I have followed your suggestions making sure that the two options in accessibility are turned off. Fix this and you have a 5 star app. Otherwise it is useless because of how annoying it is.
 - June 25, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.3.1&&&Force close on s2&&&Keep on force closing when i tried to use my presets made in former versions.
 - June 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.3.1&&&Five Stars when we can use icons&&&I'd love to use icons instead of text.  Can you make this happen?
 - June 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.3.1&&&Need to remove the voice notifications&&&Everytime i open a folder and missed it is on with accessibility, the phone says "folder open/closed"  how can i remove this?
 - June 15, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.3&&&Nova Launcher&&&How do I make it work with Nova Launcher?
 - June 17, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.3&&&Terrible&&&Continuously crashes and doesn't work. Doesn't even Gabe the options mentioned in the tutorial. No monitored elements tab in my version if the program
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 3.2.1&&&A killer app&&&Using it with widget locker is great. A very functional apps but a bit hard to config.  Not very userfriendly for beginners. But once running  its great.  Widget are user designed,  great!
 - May 25, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 3.2.1&&&Worked ok till ics&&&This doesn't work with Gmail anymore. Says I need to update gmail app but I have the latest.
 - June 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.1&&&ICS and gmail&&&Very nice app, using it together with WidgetLocker.  Those having issue with gmail notifications after upgrading to ICS and new Gmail version, reinstall the Missed it! application, it will work nicely then.
 - May 21, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.2.1&&&Under-cooked App...Refund pls!&&&I would like a refund pls, but there is no way to email the developer...the app is good in concept but that's where it stops...it randomly shows unread msgs (when infact there are none)...shows "checking licenses" frequently and for long periods...and the most crucial - it does not show notifications at the lock-up screen. If the developer is reading this, i would like my refund pls.
 - May 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2.1&&&Awesome&&&Works very well, very easy to use compared to Minimalistic Text
 - May 25, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 3.2.1&&&not good.&&&I purchased this after reading about nova launcher support, I don't use the widget, only with nova, gmail counts does not always get cleared properly, thought setting it as foreground service would help but it places an icon in task bar and notification, bugs the hell out of me, please make the icon optional!or you can actually make it do something(show missed counts?) instead of going into setup.
 - May 31, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.2.1&&&Awesome.&&&Does exactly what it says - SGSII ICS.  The licence check is annoying though, would be much better if it was done in the background.
 - May 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.2&&&Love it&&&Awesome application easy to use & customisable to boot you can't go wrong ;-) if you want it on your lock screen install one that supports widgets like widgetlocker!
 - May 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 3.2&&&Great utility&&&Excellent for building a "glanceable" summary of updates on my homescreen without having to pull down the notification bar!

 - April 30, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.1.2&&&Sgs2 issue&&&Worked great but now after the last update I don't get Gmail notifications. I'm on an att galaxy s 2.
 - May 1, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.1.2&&&Pretty good&&&It works pretty good, my only complaint is for facebook notifications, it opens the camera app
 - April 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 3.1.2&&&3rd Party Email Fixed!&&&Last update fixed all my issues.   Great app!

 - April 29, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.1.2&&&..&&&Still have problem with facebook
 - April 26, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 3.1.1&&&Question&&&I like the app concept. It does take some time to figure out, but thats part of the fun. I do have one code I cannot break. I cannot get the background to NOT show. Can anyone help with that please?
 - April 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.1&&&Works a treat!&&&Love this app! It does what it says on the tin and works brilliantly when placed on my lockscreen.  @Golf - Have you tried going to Appearance > Color (under the background title)? Works fine for me. @twitter... - Make sure it's a ttf file in \sdcard\fonts. Mine show up fine, also make sure it's in your internal memory for your phone (your SD card is reported as \sdcard\external_sd\fonts).
 - April 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.1&&&Perfect! I use it right on the home screen.&&&It is easy to configure and highly customizable! Disregard all the negativity, trust me. Their is no better all in one notification counter widget. Thanks developers!
 - April 23, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.1&&&Awful licensing checks&&&Great app but the constant licensing checks are ridiculous, especially because it NEVER WORKS. So basically this is an app that only works when it feels like it, but you still pay for it.
 - April 20, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Defy &&& 3.1&&&Refreshing gmail number&&&The new (3.1) version Gmail numbers not refreshing in the widget, When i enter and quit the appication the number is refreshing. The previous version had no such problem, although it is another method used to gmail account.
 - April 20, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.1&&&Getting there!&&&A great app but I'd like different size Widgets (2x1 and 1x1).
 - April 21, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.1&&&Hopeless&&&More bugs than in a rainforest. 165 unread emails? Really?

 - March 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.5&&&I buy and pay&&&This app don,t work in my GT-i9100 version 4.0.3 GBL   Repair hurry up                                                                                                Thank you
 - April 2, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 3.0.5&&&Fonts&&&It says I can use my own from the SD card but none of my fonts are available when I go to choose. Only serif, sans, monospace, etc.
 - April 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.5&&&Use this for Google Voice counters!&&&This app can count how many times any application creates a notification.  There are many people (including me and my friends) who have been looking for a clean way to show how many missed texts/voicemails we had from Google Voice and this app does that perfectly (assuming you don't care the count is the sum of texts and voicemails).  Great replacement for (large and ugly) Google Voice widget!  Dev should market this feature more since Google has not opened up the GVoice API and there are tons of bad apps out there that claim to do this, but fail or implement it poorly!
 - February 28, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 3.0.5&&&Don't update if u havn't yet!&&&It stops working after update. It won't even count!  Please change it back to the previous version So it can function properly.
 - April 11, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.0.5&&&Worth it!&&&A little bit of a learning curve with this app, but the functionality is definitely there. Wish we could have icons next to the counters.
 - April 10, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.5&&&No save?&&&Would not allow me to save my presets ... big downer for me ...
 - March 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 3.0.5&&&Awesome App!&&&Using this widget on my lock screen with WidgetLocker. Works like a charm & has a lot of options for customization.
 - March 16, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.5&&&Good but as others have said&&&Gmail, phone call are displayed ok, but carrier email client email numbers are displayed incorrectly at the minute. Still nice though!
 - March 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 3.0.5&&&VERY CUSTOMIZABLE&&&One of my favorite apps. In my top 5, easy. Updates are always good. Visit the forum. Post screenshots.
 - March 25, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.5&&&Great apps!&&&But it crash on samsung i9100 with ics4.0, please fix.

 - February 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.5&&&Works great&&&Galaxy s2
 - February 13, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.4&&&SMS count wrong&&&- Difficult/quirky to configure - SMS count wrong(doubled up)  When configuring background color, I notice that upon configuring alpha(transparency), sometimes the setting doesn't "take".  So you'd have to go back to adjust it.  Tested SMS and the app doubles up on the true count, which is a bug that needs to be addressed.
 - February 1, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 3.0.4&&&Was GREAT before most recent update&&&Previously reviewed MissedIt! and gave it one star for the bad update. After toying around with it for a while, i was finally able to rebuild my old widgets. That being said, dealing with the templates and the "defaults" is still very confusing and the app is overall more difficult to figure out. Wish things were like they were before 3.0.
 - February 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.4&&&Excellent&&&Excellent app, very customizable. Move feature being able to save as preset. Better menu structure. Thanks
 - February 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.4&&&Great app&&&Worth every penny.

 - January 26, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.3&&&Good&&&I think alot of people are been harsh here, granted it took a few moments to get to grips with how its laid out, but it works a treat. Once you work out your way round the menus its becomes easy.  i would however like to se the tap to edit return.  htc sensation, launcher pro, widget locker
 - January 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 3.0.3&&&Back to Good&&&Rated it one star previously for the update that requires redoing all the customization but after redoing everything, it back to good. Still poss with the non backward compatibility.
 - January 27, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Desire S &&& 3.0.3&&&Good in priciple&&&But the preset settings not loading is a bit of a dissapointment. Regret updating without backing up first but happy with widget overall.
 - January 25, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 3.0.3&&&It used to worked well.&&&Ever since i've updated the app, it no longer updates the notifications properly. It'll remain one star until it's fixed
 - January 24, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.3&&&Bad Update&&&the new update is horrible..  not only does it not save your previous settings, it's impossible to reconstruct it back to what you had. the presets don't even work.  what a waste.
 - January 24, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.3&&&Presets no longer work&&&I cant get the app to load any presets after the update..
 - January 24, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 3.0.3&&&Needs fixing&&&New update makes it very confusing. Please update again or go back to the way it was
 - January 21, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 3.0.2&&&Losing transparency now fixed&&&Latest update fixed my issues. Not fond of recreating my widgets... but I can get passed that.
 - January 22, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Droid Charge &&& 3.0.2&&&More trouble than it's worth.&&&I had a perfectly nice widget on my lockscreen. Now I have to waste time figuring out how to rebuild it using a much more complicated system. Gee, thanks.

 - January 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.1&&&Easy to use yet powerful&&&This app is an essential companion to any lockscreen. Easy to use but powerful control over notifications. Develepor is responsive and active.
 - January 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.1&&&update works for me&&&I too use this with widgetlocker and so far, so good. I certainly haven't seen any of the problems mentioned elsewhere. 4 stars only because i had to remake the widget
 - January 19, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.1&&&Update at your own risk!&&&Used to be perfect, now its full of bugs but can be made to function after a lot of tinkering. Shadow no longer works no matter what you try though!
 - January 17, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 3.0.1&&&Update resets everything.&&&Want to start with a clean slate and not have those pesky personal settings remain? Then I highly recommend this update.  Seriously though, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE UPDATE.
 - January 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 3.0.1&&&great app!&&&This app is essential, it should be included in android by default, stupid slide down notification bar

 - January 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire S &&& 2.1.0&&&Awesome app&&&Totally changed the way I use my android. Unlike iPhones, many android apps don't have the option to have notification badges. As a result, I uses to miss a whole bunch of stuff. Not anymore! Thanks, Missed It!
 - June 8, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Ace &&& 2.1.0&&&Awesome app. As good as minimalist text.&&&Just wish the third party notifications would reset to zero when they're gone. I have 37 whatsapp notifications still? and they will only increase. Until I reset the whole widget. How about getting this right? Thanks.
 - November 9, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 2.1.0&&&Amazing.&&&Everything works great on my GS2.  Works on the new Gmail, you just have to add it like you do with the other apps.  If it's not working for you, it's probably user error.

 - December 15, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 2.1.0&&&Good and works&&&Please allow removal of default message and missed calls as some may be using third party apps. Other than that, would be good to have some themes.

It works for messages and gmail and calls but I was unable to get any other apps to work with it, even after going to the accessibility menu and activating it as suggested. Really all I want is for it to work with Calls and Social Hub since the Social Hub includes sms messages, facebook, twitter, and all of my mail accounts in once place. Would be the ultimate in simplicity. I don't want to clutter the screen with 5 dif email accounts.

 - March 13, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&&&&&Nice idea&&&This is a nice idea, but it has a few problems. Firstly it really needs some documentation, ideally somewhere that is easy to find. And secondly it seems to cause random reboots on my GSM GNex (Stock, 4.0.2), although this is purely my speculation and I have no hard data.  But, the application does what it's supposed to do, is fairly easy to figure out and works pretty well. Add icons, documentation and look into the ICS reboot issue, and it will be much better.
