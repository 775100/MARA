 - July 1, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 2.1.5.2&&&Used to be amazing, but now..&&&Ever since the latest updates tailored to ICS, Ilauncher has lost it's stability on my Gingerbread device. Exiting apps result in motion-blured freeze-ups where the dock and bottom row of icons disappear. Also, the iOS-like zooming effect of the icons is now gone. So for now, despite it's inability to customize icons - unlike iLauncher - I'm using Espier Launcher. I keep checking, either for an OTA update to ICS, or for iLauncher's return to it's former glory.
 - June 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.1.5.2&&&Finally a decent launcher&&&even though its has small flaws like no live wallpaper yet and small bugs the developer(s) are fixing them and updating this app frequently. I would pay 10 euro for this app BUT PAID 1 DOLLAR. Thanks a lot FOR CREATING ILAUNCHER  Can you possibly fix customization for dock? Like hide it or make it transparent or change it?   And is it possible to make a enable/disable search screen?  possible to fix ilauncher Icon change? or even settings by double tapping or holding anywhere at the screen?  possible to hide any kind of app?  Overall possible to make it more dynamic and configurable please? I ll buy it again even if u higher the price.

 - July 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 2.1.5.1&&&samsung s 4g better than espier&&&For the guy who asked why he can't get ipad theme, it's because they are basically the same program but just modified. They aren't themes, so you can't install it twice.
 - July 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Exhibit 2 4G &&& 2.1.5.1&&&It needs a notification number for the apps&&&This is the best app to me but can you make like the little numbers come along with it like for twitter,app store,facebook,tumblr,instagram and etc. PLEASE

 - June 28, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.1.5.1&&&Good fix&&&Developer had a really good response time in fixing the bad glitches in the previous release. I would still like to see hidden apps, since there are so many unwanted ones on my screen and the Spotlight search doesn't take me directly to what I want. If I search for a contact and click it, I am brought to my general contacts screen, not the contact. If this continues to improve it will be the best iPhone emulator launcher for Android hands down.

 - June 17, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Ace &&& 2.1.4&&&Stopped working...&&&This is a great launcher epecially for android fans who want to get a feel of an iphone.  However, the last update is not working properly. Hope the ilauncher team can fix this problem.
 - June 17, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Mini &&& 2.1.4&&&More sorting icon options&&&I think the dev need to update more often. There's an app's in the market that definitely rivals your I launcher. It's espier launcher. It's way ahead compare to I launcher. I hope on the next update, the dev upgrade the resolution of the icon because espier launcher icons is more detailed and higher resolution.
 - April 18, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Ace &&& 2.1.3.4&&&Any new thing comming soon...&&&Need some new features to be ahead. Otherwise there is rival espire launcher in android market competing you app for free.

 - April 11, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.1.3.4&&&Love this app!!!&&&Just needs some work. If my phone's screen turns off when I wake it up the screen just shows the wallpaper no icons. Pressing home retrieves the icons but thats not as smooth.
 - April 8, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Mini &&& 2.1.3.4&&&Whre are you Dev?&&&It's been tooooooo long since the last update. All we afe waiting for is the multi-task bar and/or the iphone notification bar. After those then this is the perfect launcher
 - March 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 2.1.3.4&&&Amazing!&&&It's buttery smooth, you can use icon packs designed for the iphone and you don't have to tweak a zillion options to make it look great! I LOVE the way it stretches existing icons! It really rocks.

 - June 14, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.1.3.4&&&Needs Lockscreen, icons&&&Is there a lockscreen for this app in the future and if so how long, plus is it possible to get the apps to stay on the third page... The first page is the search bar, the second should display your wallpaper, and the third should start all the apps and icons...
 - April 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 2.1.3.4&&&More than best launcher for android!&&&But I guess Apple found and killed him coz it was too similiar to iOS : D I still  wait for updates and hope someone can make (iOS like) launcher good as this cause Espier launcher is so bad looking!

 - April 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 2.1.3.4&&&Amazing!!&&&Great job, no bugs so far, looks exactly like an iPhone, but please keep updating
 - May 26, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.1.3.4&&&nice start, but buggy&&&A simpler, single-level launcher is a nice idea, and this is a good start.  Unfortunately, it is rather buggy.  For example, when creating folders, the folders and the apps they contain just disappear completely.  The launcher also has copied some of the worst features of the iPhone launcher, such as the weird dance when trying to drop an icon into a folder.  Trying to change between screens while moving icons often ends up trying to uninstall an app.  And while I like this style of launcher in general, I wonder whether it really needs to stick so slavishly to the original.  For example, the ability to add widgets to the home screens or to rearrange screens via zoom out and dragging wouldn't kill the simplicity of the launcher but make it a lot more usable.  In addition, I'd prefer if it used the original Android icons, or at least gave me a choice.
 - May 16, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.1.3.4&&&Very good app&&&There's one thing that could be added: multi- tasking function like in Espier Launcher

Some suggestions though: option to change spotlight search to the Google search would be cool, multitasking, a lock screen, widget support, and status bar would totally make this app a 10 star! (Which isn't even possible but this app would be so good that it creates it!) Been using this on both a tablet and phone and I love it!

 - February 25, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.1.1.4&&&Down to 3 stars&&&The phone is LG Optimus Chic with Froyo 2.2. Espier Launcher devs work faster and now their app is much better. For some reason iLauncher looks kind of dark and with blurry icons. Good animations but still no built-in task manager, no widget support, UI is slower than Espier. I have paid for iLauncher to support the dev but I'm not using it anymore.
