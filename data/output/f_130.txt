 - May 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.4.0&&&Great work&&&Works really well on flashed droid 2 (cm9 rom). Love the conservative governor and the profiles. For some reason it won't let the cpu drop bellow 200mhz as a min. It did for a bit then stopped. Still works great otherwise. Max 1.2ghz overclock
May 22, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.4.0&&&Don't waste your money&&&used to work all the time and was great. now it force closes all the time and i can't do anything (couldn't do that much to start either cause of the phone i have). is not worth the money and headaches. don't buy it, just find another app. only thing this has going for it is it looks flashy, other than that it's complete junk.
 - April 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 2.4.0&&&Amazing on Droid X&&&Works instantly with root. With profiles I can set it to underclock when temps reach too high or battery reaches a certain level.  When gaming I crank it up to 1.25 / 1.35 and it flies.   Returns an error when background data is off, it requires it to make sure it's not a free version. Obviously not a problem just a side note.
 - April 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 2.4.0&&&Droid razr&&&Got the app on my Droid it worked great and was stable just got my Droid razr and at start told me bad kernel files please update sad I can't overclock it just yet hopefully next update

Its perfect... and people- if you get a new phone, don't expect it to just oc your device simply because it worked on the last one. There's more to this than just installing an app. There's a lot of people working on the razr right now so just chill. Or do it yourself ;)

All just to retroactively make sure the developer got paid.
