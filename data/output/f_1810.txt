 - April 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.2.14&&&Thanks&&&Best unit conversion app in the market, and it keeps getting better!
 - April 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.2.14&&&Absolutely BRILLIANT&&&Great, useful app, very very nice user interface, personally never had any bugs or force closes, plus developer very helpful & responsive. Highly recommended!!!
 - June 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG myTouch Q &&& 1.2.14&&&I don't say awesome, fantastic, I just say&&&it's well written, designed, and intuitive to use. It replaced two (three is you count its free version) on my phone.  I had a calculator app, a temperature conversion app, and unit converter free. It has the right features for me, one that stands out is the start up selection; you may  choose to start with conversions, calculators (simple, general calculator, tip calculator, or Paypal fee calculator), or favorites.  I don't generally like tool suites, they often have unnecessary features, bloat one doesn't use.  This one is exceptional; it even includes the capability of hiding conversions you may not need.  The free version could have done most of the  operations I needed, but the added features of the paid version I can use, will use, and also paying is a way of saying Thank You to someone I probably won't meet to shake his hand. Try the free version, you'll like it; if you don't upgrade at least say thank you in a review. Wopnersoft gal or guy, I owe you a handshake and a Pilsner or lemonade.

 - November 18, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.2.9&&&Best unit converter app...&&&Best unit converter app on the Android Market by far. There's practically a conversion for every kind of unit for every type and the user interface looks awesome.
