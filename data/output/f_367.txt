 - June 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.4.4&&&Impressive&&&Take the time to give this app a go.  The degree of customisation makes it useful for any teacher, and it makes it so easy to collect data to give a clear picture of student level. The developer is very good and resolved my problem in no time. I am considering buying an android tablet to make better use of this program in my classroom. If only it would mark for me as well...

 - May 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.3.7&&&Configurable and versatile&&&I have been delighted with this app and with the support given. The developer has proved to be immediately responsive to requests for modification and patient with communications. The most important thing is that the programme does the job, but it also has a very pleasing design and functions smoothly and intuitively. It is absolutely ideal for my purposes.

 - February 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.4.3&&&Useful but takes some thought&&&A terrific and powerful app that is useful. However, it takes some working out (tutorials on the accmpanying website) and a lot of setting up. Needs careful use as you cannot change register entries such as an absent to a late. Cannot use more than one grading system such as SATA to y9 and abc in y10+.  Other than this well worth the 99p.
 - January 31, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.2&&&If you're a teacher, get this!&&&Tried and bought a few teacher apps, this one's the best for my needs: clean look, reliable import/export functions, customisable, help options on each screen, backup options, and secure!  You can also take attendance, keep track of assignments, add reminders per student or class... If you're a teacher, get this, it's a bargain, cheaper than a paper notebook, you'll be better organised. It has already saved me quite some time!
