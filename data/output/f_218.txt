 - July 5, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.7.0.1&&&Works&&&This app works as advertised. Unfortunately it always shows the icon at left on JB. The level of English in this app is so poor it's hard to tell what some features are supposed to do.
 - July 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.7.0.0&&&Love it, much needed app.&&&Thanks for being there when my ROM wasn't. :')
 - July 5, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.7.0.0&&&Needs more options&&&Read my old review and realized they fixed everything... 5 stars very worth it however!!!! The icon isn't being forced to the right anymore
 - July 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.7.0.0&&&Poor app design&&&Licensing errors!  I've already paid for this app and every now and then I get a license error!
 - July 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.7.0.0&&&Nice update! But hope the battery icon can be brighter&&&Best partner of galaxy Nexus
 - July 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.7.0.0&&&ESSENTIAL APP&&&I couldn't live without this app...After last update can no longer hide icon to the right, please fix and it will be 5 stars again...
 - July 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.7.0.0&&&New update issue&&&I love this app but the latest update does not allow you to hide the invisible icon at all.
 - July 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 1.7.0.0&&&Great...&&&Great app but latest update has broken the ability for the icon to be forced to the right side
 - June 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.6.1.2&&&Awesome&&&Not updating to top after last update :-( ---- Just what I was looking for. I use this app all the time, very convenient and well worth the price. Excellent customer support. Last update makes it even better. This is one of my favorite apps, and it's a must have for the Galaxy Nexus.
 - June 29, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.6.1.2&&&Needs Improvement for 4.1 Jelly Bean&&&It works on JB 4.1, but it needs some improvements. The watchdog no longer works so it won't keep it at the top. Not sure if the refresh interval is supposed to keep it at the top of the notification bar. If it is suppose to, then on JB it isn't working either. The only other thing not working on JB is the No Show Icon. It's not placing it on the far right.   This is only a review of it on JB. On ICS 4.0.4 it worked perfectly!  Galaxy Nexus (Toro) CMDA VZW LTE

 - May 29, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.6.1.0&&&Useful&&&Very useful app. Could use a couple more settings:3G/4G toggle right from the notification bar rather than going into settings. Separate  buttons for silent/vibrate/normal mode. Also transparent background will be nice with halo theme for all the icons.  Overall, definitely worth the money. Keep up the good work!
 - May 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.6.1.0&&&Perfect!&&&This app gets better & better with each update & the latest one with the Watchdog made it perfect! Thank you Dev for a great app!

 - June 10, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.6.1.0&&&4G toggle&&&4g button is great. Now just need the GPS button to directly turn on n off instead of bringing you to options.   Great app
 - May 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.6.1.0&&&Does exactly what says!&&&Just  excellent. Would be perfect to be able to change order of icons!
 - May 27, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 1.6.1.0&&&Nice&&&Would be better if we can make the background transparent and the icons holo in color
 - June 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.6.1.0&&&More Amazing Panel&&&This app is great. No more annoying toggle widgets! Works great with no issues on Galaxy Nexus.

 - May 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.5.0.0&&&Posting this review 5 minutes after buying&&&This is the first app I paid for for my new galaxy nexus and it is exactly what I wanted. The stock widget for controlling these settings is nice but it takes up room on the limited home screens (not rooted/standard launcher). This is great because I can get to the settings now from any screen. Its pretty ridiculous that this wasn't already built into ICS.
 - April 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC One S &&& 1.5.0.0&&&Awsome&&&I don't need To install a custom from now. This should be standard on android.
 - April 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.5.0.0&&&Excellent app!&&&Using this on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus and it is terrific.  I put it on my wife's un-rooted Nexus also and the wireless tether function works great.  Un-rooted!  Excellent app, highly recommend.
 - May 12, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.5.0.0&&&Good&&&The only annoyance is that the panel doesn't always stay at the top of the notification tray, even if you set it to do so. Even after updates this still hasn't been fixed.

 - April 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.5.0.0&&&Excellent&&&Love the new update to keep the widget on top. Great ICS styling, could however use the addition of screen timeout button. It would be very useful on tablets.
 - April 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.5.0.0&&&Love it&&&Perfect!
 - May 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 1.5.0.0&&&Well worth the money&&&Paid for it a couple hours ago and feel that I owe it to the dev to write a review for his hard work.  Best notification toggles I've used yet.

 - April 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.0.0&&&Totally awesome and useful tool&&&Very useful to have these settings that are actually toggles, not just shortcuts to settings in the notification bar. Doesn't need rooting either. This really should be built into Android. One nice thing would be a 3G/4G toggle, instead of the shortcut now. But still very much worth it.
 - March 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.0.0&&&Awesome now with hotspot&&&Been using from the start. Great app. Lightweight. Reliable. New hotspot in v1.4 works great provided you turn wifi off first. Verizon Galaxy Nexus stock 4.0.4.

 - April 2, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.0.0&&&Great for Galaxy Nexus&&&Needs option to rearrange icons, needs NFC toggle, 4g toggle could use a 4g icon - the phone icon is kind of misleading. Emailed dev and was very happy to get a response! I like this one better than the other "notif panel toggles"! Still room for improvement. ;-)
 - March 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.4.0.0&&&Simply brilliant.&&&This is the single most useful app I have on my Galaxy Nexus. I use it constantly; it has NEVER crashed; it is simple, well-designed, and beautiful to the eye. A+++++++++! The computer engineer(s) responsible should get an award.
 - April 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.0.0&&&Good&&&However it doesn't always stay at the top which is somewhat annoying
 - March 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.0.0&&&Great App!&&&This is a lot better than using widget~ but for mobile data, any way to switch on immediately instead of checking the data enabled button?

 - April 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.4.0.0&&&Needs 4g and led flashlight toggles!&&&This app would be perfect if it only had 4g and led flashlight toggles! Until they get these toggles, I have no choice but to stick with the app called notification toggle
 - April 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.0.0&&&Great app&&&Perfect, exactly what I was looking for.

 - March 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.3.0.1&&&Excellent, but ...&&&Really love this app especially the notification bar integration on ICS tablets but if it includes the "Screen Timeout" toggle along with the others that people requested, it would be perfect.
 - March 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.3.0.1&&&Excellent&&&I've been looking for something like this since ive had my galaxy nexus and this is just about perfect, just about. To make it perfect i would change the gps icon to on or off instead of going to the settings and to add a toggle for hotspot tethering but it's still a very very good app.

 - December 23, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&.&&&Should have been standard in ICS, but being it was lacking, this app is perfect & well worth every cent. THANK YOU!
 - December 24, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Great but...&&&Could use brightness setting and 4G toggle, and if possible no space for blank icon. But it looks and functions perfectly.
 - December 23, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Quick request&&&When you hide the notification icon it displaces all the icons over the right one space. Pretty annoying but not the end of the world. Great functionality!
 - January 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Love it&&&My droid charge had this native. I missed it on my galaxy nexus. Glad i can now have it on here as well.
 - December 23, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.1.0&&&Good but not great...&&&When icon is hidden it still takes up the first icon spot. Also, it would be better if it stayed at the top of the notification list and not drop to the bottom of the notification list as notifications start filling in. When these are fixed I would give it 5 stars.
 - December 24, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Good app&&&Good app, probably 4 or 5 stars but when you hide the notification it only blacks it out, still there.  3/4gbtoggle would be killer too
 - December 23, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.1.0&&&Just what I wanted!&&&Perfect, missed this from previous versions of android, next update should make it fit in more with 4.0
 - December 23, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.1.0&&&Awesome...just needs a little more work&&&Very nice app.  It works as it says.  I do have to agree with other comments though.  It would be nice to have a brightness setting and a flashlight button.  Also, I did notice that new notifications show up above it in the list pushing it closer to the bottom of the page (which just makes it less convenient...especially if you have a lot of notifications).  If these things could be addressed I'd give it 5 stars.  edit: so it does look like it puts itself back on the top of the list....there is just a delay.  -Galaxy Nexus
 - December 23, 2011&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.1.0&&&Great app, just a couple small changes.&&&This looks great on ICS.  I'd like the ability to re-order items, add a brightness button, and the ability to get rid of the notification icon (not just hide it and leave an empty space).
 - December 23, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Great app!&&&Great app for Android ICS! Would love to see two features: brightness toggle (high, Med, low, auto) and toggle Lte on and off. 4stars for now
 - January 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&"NICE"&&&Anyone who doesn't think so because it don't always stay at the top, Not everyone knows root, roots, or wants root! For them, "NICE"!
 - January 12, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Almost a Must Have&&&I'm glad Google finally added api's for this type of modification of Android, and this app makes good use of them, but there are some missing features. Some form of brightness needs to be added, and the ability to reorder the items would be nice. Also, the "close" button should be integrated with the battery and GPS toggles by default and not be separate. Custom rgb colors would be nice, too.   Still a good app, but hopefully the developer will continue to improve upon it.
 - December 23, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Great on galaxy nexus&&&App works great on galaxy nexus.   Needs at 4g and brightness switch as well.
 - December 22, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Uhm&&&Good idea but no brightness setting.  Hate having an extra icon up top ( even if its hidden it still takes a space ). Cant arrange order.
 - December 31, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Good app&&&Would give 5 stars but doesn't stay at top of status bar and takes up a space in the notification bar even when removed.
 - December 23, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Very useful.&&&Would like to see a way to completely remove the icon in the bar and a way to reorder the toggles.
 - December 23, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.1.0&&&Great app, one minor nitpick&&&Hiding the Notification icon doesn't hide it, only displays a blank icon. Fix that and it's perfect.
 - December 23, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.1.0&&&Great App, but... could be PERFECT.&&&Like many have said before, Sync and Brightness need to be options for this, as well as reboot/recovery for rooted users.  Being able to adjust its color would be cool too, but that's more a suggestion than complaint.  All in all, thrilled with my purchase, and look forward to more!
 - December 28, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Would like a little more&&&Very nice so far. Would like more options and the ability to rearrange icons. Otherwise serves it's function very well
 - December 23, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Good&&&Works great. Wish there were more options. IE screen brightness and 4g toggle
 - December 24, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Great for ICS!&&&Great idea. Like others say, please add brightness control and it's golden!
 - December 23, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Almost Perfect!&&&Very, very nice. Looks like its part of ICS. Please add screen brightness control. Well worth the price!
 - January 6, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Fc's like crazy&&&Really like the app for what it does, I think it provides a good amount of toggles but it force closes like crazy on me Nexus S 4G - cm9
 - December 23, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.1.0&&&Need Brightness option&&&onec this is avaible i will rate higher other wise its very nice.
 - December 28, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.1.0&&&A Must Have for Minimalists&&&Great app! Truly a must have for people who hate clutter on their homescreen. There are a couple small issues (cosmetic not an issue with stability) that I am sure will get worked out shortly. Do not let that hold you back though, if you want quick access to controls without cluttering your home screen with another widget, or putting a custom ROM on your phone, then this is the way to go. Well worth the money.
 - December 23, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Awesome!&&&Great app... will be 5 stars when it has 3G / 4G toggle (I know a lot of US Galaxy Nexus owners would love easy access to that).
 - January 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Works really well...&&&This does work well on the Galaxy Nexus.. some strange behavior for weather notifications show up above or below the panel...
 - January 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.1.0&&&Fix the few issues and it would be perfect!&&&As others have said, it's a fantastic app let down by a couple of minor issues. 1. The shortcuts should remain at the top of the notifications list at all times. It doesn't. 2. Being able to re-order the shortcuts would be good. Or, failing that, order them the same as TouchWiz (Wifi first). 3. The app notification should be able to be removed completely, not just blacked out. This causes other notifications to be pushed over to the right. 4. A brightness button would be nice for those who want it.
 - December 23, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Nice!&&&Great, but would like screen brightness added & remove icon from top notification bar. Also, custom order of buttons would be cool.
 - January 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Good start.&&&Add brightness control and 4g/3g toggle and I'll give it 5 stars.
 - December 30, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Needs work&&&Needs to stay the top notification. Add brightness and 4G data toggles. Get rid of the notification icon completely. Battery indicator doesn't change. Galaxy nexus
 - December 23, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&So close...&&&Pros: Buttons work Nice looking Cons:  Other notifications push it down (unacceptable) No brightness!!
 - December 24, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Great&&&Very helpful, I missed these buttons from my old device. Looks fantastic on OVA on my Galaxy Nexus and works as it should. Cheers.
 - December 23, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Outstanding&&&Great app. I would pay $10 for it
 - December 23, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&+1&&&Great app! Just need to add screen brightness and 4G toggle!
 - January 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.1.0&&&Must buy for Galaxy Nexus&&&Would appreciate a LTE toggle, but this is great.
 - December 23, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Very nice on Galaxy Nexus&&&Clean & efficient on gnex....  Need brightness, reboot/recovery, and flashlight buttons!  Well done.....
 - January 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Unable to hide notifications&&&I bought this thinking you could hide notifications in ICS but you can't. Hopefully the dev will add it soon.
 - December 26, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.1.0&&&Very nice app.&&&Works great. Looks great. Perfect for my use with a Samsung Galaxy Nexus.
 - December 23, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.1.0&&&Looks clean in ICS Notification Bar&&&Would like to see Brightness & Flashlight options!
 - December 23, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Decent&&&This app is good at what it does. However it needs better options like 4g. This is the most needed option for this widget period.
 - December 22, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Almost there...&&&Just needs Brightness Toggle and then its 5 stars.
 - December 22, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Love it!&&&Love that it fits in perfectly with ics. Wish you could rearrange the buttons.
 - December 23, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Really good!&&&Great seamless integration into the task bar in ICS. It looks like its a part of the android OS. Needs wifi hot spot,enable/disable data, and 3g/2g toggle to be 5 stars.
 - January 24, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&why does this app need camera access?&&&This app should not need access to my camera at any time.
 - January 9, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Nice&&&Great app but needs more options
 - December 24, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&.&&&Be nicer if GPS directly turned on/off instead of triggering location services page. Also lots of lag from the lock screen. Galaxy Nexus.
 - December 23, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Almost perfect&&&Even as it stands, it's great and well worth the 1.28. That being said, this app would be godly if it included a brightness toggle and an LTE toggle.
 - December 25, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Perfect for Galaxy Nexus!&&&Fantastic app!
 - January 7, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Handy but needs brightness&&&Very handy setting toggle app. Would be five star if it supports toggling screen brightness.
 - January 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Nice.&&&Hoping will have "toggle mobile data"
 - December 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&should be stock&&&Great app. Saves Me room for widgets
 - January 5, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Needs more toggles...&&&like Flash light, brightness, force sync...
 - January 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Works great on GC&&&A must have app!
 - December 23, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Great but when I hide the notification icon, the system acts like it's still ...&&&Great but when I hide the notification icon, the system acts like it's still there..
 - December 31, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Needs an overhaul&&&Notification icon takes up space even if not displayed. Panel is not always top notification. No brightness control.
 - December 28, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Brightness!!!???&&&
 - December 23, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.1.1.0&&&Great&&&Add more toggles

 - December 21, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.0.0.a&&&Must have for any Galaxy Nexus!&&&I wish this came on my G-Nex from the factory!! Does what it advertises! Thanks!
 - December 21, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Acer Picasso &&& 1.1.0.0.a&&&Great app&&&But please remove that annoying "the app stays  here" thing
 - December 15, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.0.0.0&&&Great app, looks good!&&&Something like this should be stock in honeycomb. It Looks and works good like it was always meant to be there. Only 4 not 5 stars because of the nagging "reminder" it has to let you know it is running and the added icon it puts in the notification area.
 - December 22, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&&&&&NEEDS BRIGHTNESS BUTTON&&&please replace the up arrow with a brightness button. not only is the up arrow a useless button, but we can push up the notification bar or press home instead of the up arrow button. please replace with screen brightness and this will get 5 stars
 - December 23, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&&&&&Good on Galaxy Nexus, just needs....&&&1) Add brightness control 2) Change GPS button to toggle GPS on/off, then it's worthy of 5 stars. I've been looking settings from the notification bar like this since I got my OG Droid.
 - December 24, 2011&&&3.0 &&&&&&&&&Pretty Good.&&&Needs work. Icon still takes up space when disabled. GPS doesn't actually turn GPS on or off,  just takes you to the GPS settings screen. A few fixes and it'll be amazing.
 - February 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&&&&&Great app on nexus!&&&Great app, NEEDS 4g toggle for LTE and GSM nexus!  Also NFC and Flashlight toggle wouldn't be bad options either!
 - December 23, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Samsung Nexus S&&&The OS should come with this&&&This fills a gap that android phones really should come with. I could think of some minor things to add (wiimax/4G switch, brightness). I also noticed when you hide the icon it creates a strange little blank area. However all in all awesome.
 - February 1, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&&&&&Not good enough for paid app&&&The app is Ok. It misses the Data On/Off Toggle which is a must for me. Generally it is a way to simple (to few features) app in order to be a paid app. My conclusion: It is not worth the money.
 - December 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&&&&&Great app!&&&I installed a beta build of ICS on my Droid X. This works great! Exactly what I've been looking for!  Feature request: Have the GPS button turn GPS on/off Rearrange order of buttons Brightness setting short click and long press actions Launch custom app Volume shortcut that displays different levels Flashlight toggle (integrate with TeslaLED?)  Great work!
 - December 26, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&&&&&looks great&&&Works perfect on the Toshiba Thrive.  Honeycomb 3.2
 - February 29, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&&&&&Awsome app&&&I love this app on my Nexus, but please add Data button, and add to buttons long press to go in the settings.
