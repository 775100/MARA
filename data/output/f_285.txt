 - June 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2&&&Fun and easy&&&Use with my Samsung galaxy s2.  Now that I'm used to it I can type faster than I could with any swype or regular keyboard. I was always a fan of t9 back in the old days and this is as close as it gets.  Lots of settings to play with for a personal look.  Like how you can adjust colors and set the f-keys for even faster texting.  The glide feature I was unsure of at first but now I dont know how I lived without it.  No complaints so far. Great keyboard and worth the measly couple of bucks!
 - May 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.2&&&Best keyboard ever!&&&I have tried every keyboard on the market. This is the easiest to use and most accurate as well.  Letters, numbers and special characters are all readily available to type. Function keys and custom shortcuts are amazing!
 - June 15, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.2&&&Starting to realize it's very buggy...&&&More and more often it is not automatically putting the suggested word when pressing space or punctuation, even though the setting is clearly on. Bugginess=uninstall.
 - May 12, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.2&&&Awesome Keyboard&&&Love it.  Aside from a swipe keyboard, this is the fastest type of keyboard for me.  Only HTC had a keyboard like this as standard as far as I know.  Only one issue: I don't know why it continues to repeat the last word when I send texts.
 - April 27, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 3.2&&&New android update issues&&&Love it, but it doesn't seem to be compatible with the new android update for Samsung nexus. It auto selects the highlighted word only sometimes and most annoyingly, not with google search. Please fix...
 - April 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.2&&&New Version - app isn't dead!&&&I've been using this keyboard as my daily for a while, with the biggest problem being that it wasn't updated in close to a year. Finally, an update came out, showing it's alive!  Sadly, the other big problem remains: No response from devs.  There's a few minor problems that are simple fixes, and I'm hoping the devs read this feedback & start checking their mail!  This keeps it at 4 starts for me until they reply.  Keypurr looks weird, but it's actually a pretty standard qwerty with a slightly compact layout.  17 keys means that Keypurr will usually get the correct word since there is little overlap (ex: "got" and "for" are the same keystrokes). Large letters combine with sliding both up and down on keys to get alternate symbols makes doing precise entry (passwords) easy. The bottom space bar row is also slightly higher to combat the frequent problem of missing the space.  You can also set up 12 quick-click buttons (appear in suggestion area between words) and user-editable shortcuts are there too!  Don't underestimate the sliding instead of the traditional hold-a-key.  Sliding will always be much faster & doesn't interrupt the flow of typing like holding a key does.
 - June 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 3.2&&&Galaxy s 4g&&&Awesome keyboard.  Lets me type really fast
 - February 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.1.1&&&3.0 is even more brilliant&&&I know I sound like a broken record, but Keypurr is nothing short of phenomenal and light years ahead of all the many other keyboards I've tried. Take them up on their 1 month money back guarantee. You'll never go back to Swiftkey, Swype or any of these variants  UPDATE: I have been switching back and forth between Keypurr and Swiftkey. Overall, there's a solid, confident feel I get from Keypurr that just makes thoughts flow better for me. I can't recommend this more.  UPDATE 2/14/2012: Still my favorite for keyboard for typing-style entry, my other favorite being Swype. Swiftkey? It's is like sugar water. Yes, it's word prediction is great, but I feel disconnected from what I'm writing.
 - April 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 3.1.1&&&Really, really nice&&&I absolutely cannot stand swype so for the longest time I've just been using Swiftkey. Yes, the text correction is nice, but it is hard to get your thoughts together. This is not the case with Keypurr. This keyboard is superior in nearly every way to any I've ever used,  and after not much use at all I amd typing very quickly on it. Bravo dev.
 - August 4, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.1.1&&&Good concept, poor execution&&&The 'flicking' feature is an improvement over other keyboards that combine multiple letters on one key. However, the keyboard seems to have some persistent bugs. Most frustrating is that the prediction system frequently fails. This makes it very hard to type fast because at any point your typing could just become gibberish because no predictions or corrections are being made. I reported this problem to the developer and the response was to add an option to disable predictions/corrections altogether!
 - December 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 3.1.1&&&This keyboard is so awesome. I can't seem to type on the stock keyboard ...&&&This keyboard is so awesome. I can't seem to type on the stock keyboard for whatever reason and then I found this.  Flicking is so intuitive and predictions are too notch.	Sometimes the keyboard would stop predicting and I have to reactivate it.  Please add more themes like all the other keyboards!
 - June 29, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Huawei M860 &&& 3.1.1&&&Loved it but uninstalled&&&I loved this keyboard! Especially the F keys. the only problem that I had was that the application force closed something like 50 times a day. Every time I looked at my phone I was clicking the go ahead and force close button. I uninstalled Adv Task thinking maybe that was closing the keyboard and causing probs, but that didn't help. I finally just gave up and uninstalled. I'd love to go back to it if the force closes could be fixed.
 - October 18, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 3.1.1&&&Transforms my Nexus&&&For me this is an indispensable app. Texting and typing is now a pleasure. There is a learning curve but well worth it in return for easy input.

 - February 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.1.1&&&Purrfect&&&I just installed it on my galaxy s II, love it. Better than swype, slideIT, and Swiftkey. This makes you feel more connected with your thoughts as you type, which makes my input faster. In my opinion, the best keyboard out there. Key shortcuts are great.
 - January 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.1.1&&&ICS&&&I can't wait for this to be updated for android 4.  Once you get the hang of this keyboard you won't switch back to anything else.
 - March 28, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.1.1&&&Best Android Keyboard I Have Used&&&I have used a number of keyboards on my Android phone, and really wasn't 100% happy with any of them. I normally 'only' like full Qwerty keyboards, as I prefer to type and never was very fast at texting on a standard mobile phone keypad. But, within a very short space of time, I found that i could type much faster on this than any other Android keyboard I had tried. The majority of what you want is on the main screen, and the cursor keys are handy if you don't have then on your phone like my desire hd.
 - February 2, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Hero &&& 3.1.1&&&Best keyboard I have tried several different software keyboards and this one is the ...&&&Best keyboard I have tried several different software keyboards and this one is the best. I tend to prefer compact keyboards because rotating the phone to use a full QWERTY is such a pain on my HTC Hero because the lag before the screen re-orients is too long and the only thing you can see in this mode is the text you are entering. Compared to the size of the keys in the built-in compact keyboard which use rows of 5 keys, the 6-key per row layout of Keypurr makes a huge difference. I love the all-in-one layout.
 - November 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.1.1&&&Tried them all&&&Tried swype, slideit, perfect keyboard, all of them. Finally found this one. Symbol and dictionary integration is by far the best. Finally happy!
