 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Acer Picasso &&& 1.5.1&&&Worth the $$&&&Excellent for the novice and experienced sky gazer  both.  Has almost all the features I've come to expect in my laptop programs, yet its for my tablet.  The one feature that should be present is changing the Android System Status Bar Icons into the nearly invisible dots.  MX Video Player is one app that accomplishes this perfectly.  It does no good to have a red night mode when the full Android Bar is still there in white light.
 - June 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 1.5.1&&&Very good app&&&As others have noted, SkySafari appears to beat the other planetarium apps with all of the information and functionality included in the pro version. Great port from IOwhatever
 - June 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.5.1&&&??????&&&???????????????????????????? ??:????????????????????????…
 - May 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.5.1&&&The one astronomy app with all the features&&&I've installed all the apps I could find.  Some did one thing fine and that's all it did.  The Pro version of Sky Safari has all the features in one product.
 - May 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.5.1&&&UNBELIEVABLE&&&This is without a doubt the best app in history for the android platform, bar none! I can't believe this is a "phone" app. The tools & functions are absolutely amazing. Thank you dev team for the finest product to hit the android market! This app rivals starry night pro for my pc! Keep up the good work. I personally have never spent this kind of money on an android app, worth every penny; in fact, I feel I got a hell of a deal!
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.1&&&Must have&&&Everything you need to know jam packed in one app!!
 - July 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 1.5.1&&&Most expensive app I've bought&&&... and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again. I find myself opening it just to see what's visible in the sky, or to run the clock back and forth to watch how the planets move past each other. And it's been a convenient resource for more information about the nebulae and other celestial objects displayed in on the APOD website.
 - June 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.1&&&Makes everything else look like a tech demo.&&&Wow! I am at a loss for words. The star field is impressive, but the show stealers are the deep sky data base and observation lists. Totally worth the price. Runs great on my Rezound and Transformer.
June 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.1&&&Very good&&&I have purchased many PC, iOS, and Android star mapping apps over the years. This is by far one of the best. I'm running it on a Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 and the performance is totally acceptable. Maybe not "buttery smooth" as the developer has stated that the iOS is but very, very acceptable. Well worth the 30 bucks! If I was given a "try buy" on this app I would have purchased it for double the price. Good stuff.
 - May 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.5.1&&&A lot of lag with version 1.5.1&&&After playing with settings, lag disappears if you don't show comets and asteroids. But still very laggy wit those elements visible.
 - June 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.5.1&&&Just what I was looking for&&&I've been using this app for only a short while but I can safely say it does its job well.   I am beginner as far as astronomy goes so having locally stored articles about space objects is a great feature. I haven't experienced any performance issues on my galaxy s3. I prefer the rendering to star chart app - it is more detailed and relative sizes and colours make sense. Also many ok objects have a photo in its description article!  Can't go wrong with this one. Perhaps a cheaper version is more value thou
 - June 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.1&&&Amazing&&&Works great, still messing with the settings though to try and reduce the small amount of lag every now and then when searching randomly. Unless I haven't found the setting yet then I would recommend the option to manually rotate the screen instead of auto rotation, can get annoying near the top and bottom of sky. Very accurate (when the actual sky is visible, was cloudy last night). Otherwise this is the best sky chart app I've found.
 - May 28, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.5.1&&&Wonderful&&&Not a fan of the new icon. Almost perfect in every other respect. I love the new Orbit feature. Only issue is the the engine lags a lot and even the compass mode is very jittery on my S2. Needs to be optimized as there are many apps and games with more complicated shapes etc that run much smoother. I know android devices have bad opengl hardware; but other apps don't use it. Please change the way you render the app to what ever other people use (Look at Star Chart). We have paid a lot of money.
 - June 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.1&&&If only all apps were this great....&&&But we'd all need more storage space. Attention to detail is incredible and praise worthy. I've owned two versions of Starry Night Pro and one version of The Sky, and as much as I enjoyed both suites Sky Safari is now my astronomy program of choice. Can't call it an "app." This is a flat-out suite. The graphics, options, and data within the program is awesome. Good idea to read FAQ page. I emailed the developers two questions that were already explained. Overall, I highly recommend it.  Awesome! Updates after more use, to include scope control. Thanks to Southern Stars!
 - July 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 1.5.1&&&Work like it says and does what it says. Need lots of room but ...&&&Work like it says and does what it says. Need lots of room but worth it.
 - June 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.1&&&Skysafari pro&&&This company/sw is the best!  Exactly what I wanted.
 - June 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.1&&&Absolutely Awesome!&&&HP Touchpad w/CM9 & ICS.  Smooth running and full featured planetarium application. Well worth the money!
 - May 31, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.5.1&&&AMAZING!&&&Even for  beginner like myself!  well worth the extra money.
 - June 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G Slide &&& 1.5.1&&&Awesome!&&&Worth every penny. Try the basic version, if you're not sure. But I'm sure you'll upgrade almost immediately.
 - June 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.5.1&&&Great app&&&
 - June 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.5.1&&&Best Astronomical app ever!&&&
 - June 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.5.1&&&Awesome&&&Awesome app. Gets better with each update.
 - June 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5.1&&&Wow&&&Wow
 - May 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.5&&&Amazing&&&Totally overkill for what I was looking for, but I'll never have to buy another sky app. Works very smoothly and reliably. Only glitch on Galaxy note is that in portrait mode while it switches the accelerometer it doesn't switch the compass from landscape to portrait thus making the sky simulation behave very strangely in portrait mode.
 - May 28, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.5&&&Great app&&&This is the only star chart I take into the field at this point. I'm constantly finding new things with this app. It's a resource hog when its running. And I agree with the jitteriness of the compass feature. Overall this is an outstanding app!
 - May 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.5&&&Amazing&&&By far the best app on android.  Worth every penny!!!! My planetarium programs on my computer aren't as complete and full of information as this app is.  Plus it runs perfectly.   The only minor annoyance would be that it doesn't keep my screen on while using it.
 - May 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Acer Picasso &&& 1.5&&&Truly stunning&&&Shows  every detail of the night sky with panoramic accuracy, love this app
 - May 20, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.5&&&Galaxy nexus&&&Stops working on any changes made in settings.
 - May 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF300 &&& 1.5&&&Great on ASUS transformer,,not on Samsung&&&First tried to use on Samsung tablet...ran fine but would not run telescope since Samsung won't allow Ad Hoc networks which is needed with my Sky Fi wireless. Swapped tablet for a Asus Transformer 101...runs flawlessly and on all of my mounts when used with Sky Fi wireless unit. Only missing function...although it works great on  my GOTO scopes (Celestron, Vixen, Astro Physics) it is  a bit less user friendly with my digital setting circle equiped mounts.  Wish it had a feature like my THE SKY where it shows two readouts for the two motions...when moved so that those numbers are zeroed out you are there. With SS you have to watch your locked in pointer as you move around looking for the object. But since I don't use the setting circles that much I can live with it..or use THE SKY on my regular computer. While I have the PRO version it is probably over kill for most people.  UPDATE I updated from older version to latest 1.5...everything is fine except evertime it opens it says can't download additional data files even though I have them. Once I bypass that note everything works fine but annoying...will see what Sky Safari recommends as fix. This is a GOOGLE issue.

 - May 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.5&&&Utterly Awesome&&&So much easier to find objects to observe with this next to my eyepiece.
 - May 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Stratosphere &&& 1.5&&&Nice.&&&Well done.
 - May 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 1.2&&&Best Astro app&&&Great functions and ease of use. Works really well on both HTC One S and XOOM table. Nice!
 - May 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.2&&&Look no further...&&&I've had them all - bought all the astronomy Palm apps, iPhone apps, iPad apps, looking for something that would meet my needs through the years.  I loved it on the iPad and iPhone 4, but when I switched to my Galaxy IIs I was FLOORED how anemic the astronomy apps were.  It made me want to switch back!   I use a Celestron 14 with a G11 mount and this software gives me everything I need right at the eyepiece.  I observe pretty much every night and Sky Safari makes astronomy data easy to get to and slick to u
 - April 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.2&&&it don't get better&&&i have been an amateur astronomer for years and i had this on the i pod touch and it was amazing but i would have to say the android version is so much better. If you are into astronomy you need this. the amount of information is mind blowing. everything is backed up by stunning photos. Worth every penny i reckon:)
 - May 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.2&&&Tho only astronomy app&&&My favorite program for Android. The most thorough compilation of astro information I've found. Replaces stacks of books and maps. The only nav tool I use for observing.
 - May 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 1.2&&&Love it&&&Was great before but now I can  control my Paramount ME. Awesome!

 - March 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.2&&&Need to field test but I'm impressed&&&The only thing it is truly lacking is the ability to determine angular separation of two object.  Why not just display it in the "info" after the second object is selected?  Beyond that, I wish it supported more eyepiece FOV overlays and that ICS had a way to make the red-mode pervasive.
 - March 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.2&&&Sky  Safari Pro&&&This app has everything any level of astronomers need and fits in the pocket as well as driving a telescope without  draging a laptop around
 - May 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X2 &&& 1.1.2&&&Simply the best...&&&Skymap and astronomy software available! It gives you the power of desktop on a portable user-friendly device.
 - March 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.2&&&Updates Always make me nervous&&&30min to load data file only error out. Galaxy Nexus with Android.  Second time was the charm. Loaded correctly on the second try.
 - March 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.1.2&&&Love this app!&&&The whole reason I bought a smart phone was so that I could utilize some of the astronomy apps out there. I was a bit iffy about spending the money on this but it was worth buying. I love that all data is stored on your phone, so you don't need an internet connection to view it. There are so many items in the database, I find it very useful when I'm using my telescope. I don't need to worry about having an up to date sky map now, I just use this wherever I am.
 - May 22, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 1.1.2&&&1.2 update is over 400mb? It wont even install on my device. I'm glad ...&&&1.2 update is over 400mb? It wont even install on my device. I'm glad i got 1.1 Fix the size again and it will be a 5 star.
 - April 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.2&&&Excellent app!&&&At first I was a little apprehensive about paying 30 euro for an android app, but I'm glad I decided to "bite the bullet". This app is worth every cent and I would urge anyone interested in astronomy with an Android device to buy this. It has many features, and is as good, if not better, than many more expensive software packages for PCs. The huge 15 million object database is its main strength with every celestial body imaginable included, and I love the panoramic horizon views.
 - March 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.1.2&&&The best by far!&&&After using this app I uninstalled all of my other star apps. This one blows them all away. DroidX
 - April 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.2&&&Thank you&&&Thanks for allowing phone data download and not just wifi!  Beautiful program.
 - March 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.1.2&&&Working flawless on my Galaxy Note.&&&I'm very new to astronomy and was considering the plus version. this is probably more than enough, but I'm glad I got it. =)

 - December 26, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X2 &&& 1.0&&&Great Start!&&&Needs serious speed improvement even on a duel core powerhouse device.  They are iOS devs so it may take some time before we get an optimized product on Android.  Combine this with the app "Mobile Observatory", your all set with astronomy software!
 - December 27, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0&&&Best Sky App for the Android&&&I've used them all on both Android and Iphone.  There is no doubt why SkySafari is the 2012 Astronomy app of the year.  Easy to use and navigate, great menu features to set magnitudes, good information on viewed objects.  This app is highly recommended for both the beginner and advanced astronomer.
 - December 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.0&&&Finally...&&&Been waiting for this! The assurance of finding anything I want to see, the fluidity of navigating, the aesthetic you've designed the sky and multicolor stars with are all what makes your app stand out for me. As a teacher not just of celestial bodies but of their moving cycles and orbital nuances I'm super pleased with this. Again, FINALLY!
 - December 23, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0&&&Winner by a Light Year!&&&SkySafari is the new number one Astronomy App by a light year.  Refinement everywhere you observe! Replete and complete. Magnitudes deeper than everything else.This is the one Android app that we astronomers have been waiting for. For the professional or amateur star gazer, it rivals the usefulness of desktop astro apps and is some ways does even more!  Absolutely incredible on a Toshiba 7 inch Thrive tablet.
 - December 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0&&&First Android app for serious amateur astronomers&&&This is the best astronomy app for Android, period.  Lots of customization options for charts, observing list support, and a big astronomical database make this the only Android app with enough depth to be useful for serious observing with binoculars or a telescope.  Plus it can do everything the more casually oriented astro apps do, including a gorgeous view of the sky and the ability to hold your phone/tablet up to the sky and have it show you what you see.  Worth the price.
 - December 25, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0&&&First astronomy app for android&&&Why is this the first astronomy app. First of all a true astronomy app needs to have something called a database. The Messier objects and a few stars is not considered a database. Plotting all of the NGC is getting there but still not a database. A true deep sky database needs to go beyond the ngc and plot king, melotte, collindar, basel, pk, and dark nebula. This is the first astronomy app for android that has done this. It also is the first to have a huge database comets and asteroids. It plots all of the moons. This is a serious full fledged astronomy app. I am amazed! WOW after 3 plus years android has been out it finally gets an astronomy app. All of the astronomy toys that was on my phone are deleted.
 - December 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.0&&&Fantastic!&&&SkySafari is the best astronomy software for Android. Its rendering of the sky is the most accurate and beautiful, and also the easiest to correlate with the real sky. SkySafari Pro also wins on features, and in spite of its power it is still very easy to use. I’m very happy with my purchase.
 - December 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0&&&Superb serious amateur astronomy software&&&This is easily and by far the best astronomy software for Android devices.  I think it's better than Stellarium for the desktop.  Superb coverage of the solar system (planets, minor planets and comets) and deep sky objects.  Good information on various objects.    It's great to have outlines of wide deep sky objects.    The Pro version adds tons of stars.  From my experience with Palm apps, for serious star-hopping and identifying of faint objects with a decently sized telescope (I have a 13"), one really should benefit from having the greater depth of coverage that the Pro version provides over the Plus version.    Hint 1: If you have a somewhat slower device, you can greatly improve smoothness by setting the Horizon to Transparent with Line and turning off Milky Way textures.  Hint 2; While the built-in night mode works well, it doesn't affect the on-screen keyboard keyboard or any soft keys on screen if your device have them.  For rooted devices, you can install ChainFire3D and use its night mode, and for unrooted devices, you might try my own free "GB keyboard with optional night mode".
 - December 26, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.0&&&Finally!!!&&&I have been waiting for an Astronomy app like this one, for Android for 2 1/2 years now.  Nothing else compares.  This is the first star atlas app that can actually be used at the telescope.  It's as powerful as many desktop astronomy software.  It could use some speed improvements, but I'm sure that it will improve over time.  Thanks for the great app!!!
 - December 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - HTC Nexus One&&&Best astronomy app and Telescope Control, too!&&&I have used almost every astronomy app for Android that was available since I first got my trusty G1. Google SkyMap was our first "wow, neat!" astro-app.  Others that required a donation just left me hanging.  Currently, there are several sub-par ports of iOS programs. This blows them all out of the water. It's also the only one with telescope control via Bluetooth or WiFi. I've used it on my iPad2 for months and it opens up new realms of possibilities, especially if you do outreach events. Having volumes of information (with pictures, too) about every significant object in the sky is a HUGE help.  If you are SERIOUS about astronomy, SkySafari is it.
 - May 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1&&&Really impressive!&&&This is probably one of the most expensive aps you can buy - and worth EVERY penny!  Authors are very responsive and helpful. Everyone who has any interest in a first-rate planetarium program need look no further than one of the 3 levels of this ap.  If you plan to use for observing, pop for the Pro version. I now use my Tab to run my goto telescope via Bluetooth - what a blast! Scan the sky to any mag limit, touch an object, and 10 sec later you're viewing it.  Wonderful!
 - December 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Samsung Galaxy S2&&&The best astronomical app for Android !&&&Very detailed, useful for star hopping while observing. Tip : use red transparent foil then all apps , keypad and soft keys are in shades of red or (when your device is rooted)  install Chanifire 3D. Lots of comets and asteroids which orbital elements are frequently updatable. Very realistic display of the sky. Does not require an internet connection.
 - April 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&&&&&Awesome!&&&The application is amazing first of all, but the developers contacted me right away with questions and problems I had.  They were incredible.  Please buy this app.  It is worth every penny.
 - May 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - EeePad Transformer TF201&&&It is the best,  but ...&&&... I wish the authors weren't so biased towards Apple. Just because Android may not allow you to do things the same way Apple does, that doesn't mean it's an inferior product.
 - May 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&&&&&Fantastic&&&Very good app. Worth the money
 - June 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&&&&&Buy It NOW!&&&Awesome app. Spent more on this one app than all others I've purchased. Worth every penny. Can't wait to buy the hardware to use this with my schmidt cass.
