 - March 30, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 2.1.3&&&Great app, but do you call that a widget?!&&&Very nice design. I like how it closely matches the Android Email and Calendar apps. It's the app that Android should have as standard.  Now, the one problem is the Widget (or lack of!) Would be 5 stars if you had anything near a decent widget. A 1 by 1 widget? Come on, surely you can do better than that. A nice simple widget that matches your well designed app is desperately needed to make it really stand out from the crowd.
 - May 11, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G Slide &&& 2.1.3&&&Fix the widget for 5 stars&&&The widget is pretty ridiculous, especially for a paid app. Shouldn't be that hard for the dev to fix....
 - March 26, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 2.1.3&&&Wasted Money on This APP&&&Don't waste your money.  Does not work.  Look elsewhere.
 - May 15, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Tab &&& 2.1.3&&&Downgraded upgrade&&&I loved this app when I first got it because it was the only app out there that synched up with Exchange, displayed my entire task list message, and did not require additional software to run. Now, it's just like every other app out there, because it truncates the task title, so that all I see are messages that say thins like "Update the Me.." Very disappointed.
 - May 5, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 2.1.3&&&Does not support ActiveSync&&&It worked on my previous job, no more because the app doesn't support ActiveSync. Please support ActiveSync.
 - April 30, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 2.1.3&&&Fair app&&&It would ne nice to see old completed tasks

 - March 30, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Iconia Tab A100 (VanGogh) &&& 2.1.3&&&Solid&&&Works well with exchange 2007. Have fewer layers to work through, or use check boxes that autohide completed tasks. It has a nice layout, visually nice.
 - April 2, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.1.3&&&Love it&&&But could you include an ICS theme?
 - April 23, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 2.1.3&&&Problem with server&&&Potentially this is a great little app. The problem is that every few days it drops my MS Exchange settings and so stops syncing.
 - March 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 2.1.2&&&Good&&&Best one on the market
 - March 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 2.1.2&&&Even Better&&&This has been a great app and has just got better. Works perfectly!
 - March 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 2.1.1&&&Brilliant!&&&The best tasks management app for Exchange! The new interface is great and the sync management better. Works well with our hosted Exchange 2007. Could be even better with a customizable widget (look and information)
 - March 16, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.1.1&&&New version doesn't work as expected&&&2.1.x has a much better interface.  But it's killing my battery even though it was set to sync once an hour.  And the ironic thing is that it never sync properly.  Go figure.  Please fix.  I reverted back to 2.0.
 - March 16, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 2.1.1&&&Good responsive developer&&&Good app, works well. Previous update caused a problem and developer quick to sort it out.

 - August 11, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Droid 3 &&& 2.0.13&&&Needs a larger, better widget&&&I would up this to five stars for a better, larger widget. Ideally, I'd like to see a 4x2 widget with a list of uncompleted tasks. Not too unique looking, so that it blends with my other widgets.
 - January 31, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 2.0.13&&&Best tasks app for Outlook users&&&Great app, very stable.  I'm on Droid razr maxx and GoDaddy hosted exchange. Wisj it highlighted phone numers and addresses for easy calling and mapping

 - January 8, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.0.13&&&Trouble on Xoom&&&Can't add tasks on Xoom as the menu button isn't displayed on the bottom of the screeen and the choices presented by the button in the upper right of the screen doesn't included add task.  Ok on Desire but was told long ago prior to purchase that allowing display of completed tasks was a future improvement and when I queryed why it wasn't done I was told all efforts were focus on Tasblets.  Now I find tablets still don't work right.
 - September 10, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.0.13&&&Simply best&&&Simple and useful. The best one so far which connects with MS Outlook via Exchange Server.
 - March 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 2.0.13&&&Liking the new look&&&The app works great. I use it to drop in quick To-Do items on my work Outlook Task list. The new look is a much needed improvement.

 - September 4, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 2.0.13&&&Well, it works....&&&It only works; sync via a timed poll. Push would be nice. The interface is plain Jane. Lastly the widget is pointless its an overgrown shortcut.
 - April 25, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 2.0.13&&&As promised&&&Set up was simple, used the same settings as my existing exchange account. Synced perfectly. Using Motorola Droid with 2.2.2. Really needs a larger widget. Widget shows a count of overdue and today's tasks. Would like a list.
 - August 11, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Desire S &&& 2.0.13&&&Assign task to 'me' when creating&&&When you create a new task in Outlook it automatically assigns to the current user logged on to Exchange. Any task in Outlook can have assignee (user who created the task, or user the task was delegated to). When you create task from phone using this app then assignee is empty. Thank you!
