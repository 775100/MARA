 - June 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Awsome&&&I love this app. Totally worth the money.  Makes the notification like perfect only Galaxy Nexus.  Developer responds to issues in emails.   Great developer.
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&galaxy nexus&&&love your app. recent update is great loving the new interface. only thing is that now there is a delay on some system sounds. the lock screen sound and volume up down sound have a half second delay. still 5 still highly recommended
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Excellent plus cool application&&&Bought this application last week, less impressive UI but great functionality. Latest update improved the UI so much it deserves nothing less than 5 stars!!
 - June 25, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.2&&&Fantastic&&&Let me be clear about this.. This is the SINGLE MOST USEFUL APPLICATION YOU CAN GET FOR YOUR LED ENABLED PHONE. On the gs3, there are so many colours to chose from for the gs3 led, and this app supports so many other apps notifications. I don't even have to unlock my phone to know what Ive missed, I just look at the colour of the LED! Latest update seems to cause some battery drain. Better battery stats says almost 3000 wakelocks in 24 hours and my battery graph shows my phone is barely sleeping. Pls fix..
 - July 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Love this&&&This app worked flawlessly on 4.0.3.  I really like the new interface, goes perfectly with the holo theme. On Jellybean, its hit or miss. I'm not holding it against the Dev, but I do miss my notification light ;-P - Galaxy Nexus GSM 4.1
 - June 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.2&&&Galaxy S3&&&Good app but would be better if my phone didn't start talking to me.
 - June 20, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.2&&&Doesn't work very well&&&Having bought this app for my SGS 3, I now realise what a mistake that was...it doesn't work properly as it clashes with the accessibility settings...there's quite a few people with the same problem ie phone speaks back to u even though you have disabled the accessibility options. Very poor and disappointed with the devs, shouldn't be charging for what is essentially a useless app on the SGS 3...Unless you like your phone talking to u in public then I recommend you staying away from it.
 - June 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.2&&&Works Great, but...&&&This app does a great job configuring your phone to display certain notifications using the LED light.  The new UI update makes it even better to configure your settings.  The only thing is notifications will not clear on Android 4.1 Jelly Bean.  I know that this version of Android  has just been released and there could already be updates in the works for this version. Just wanted to point it out.
 - June 25, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Was working perfectly&&&Why did I update :(  Is it possible to get the older version? Had no issues. Now I feel that the lighting doesn't work 100% on my gnexus.
 - July 2, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.2&&&Awesome app but uses some battery&&&The latest update makes the interface slow and laggy, albeit pretty. And im running it on a quadcore Galaxy S3, something has to be wrong with the coding. The battery issue is minimized by using priority mode.  Also a great developer behind this app.
 - June 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Works again!&&&Ever since the last update,  3.0, the app hasn't worked since.   I un installed and reinstalled and cleared the app cache to no avail.   Finally after disabling and re-enabling notifications inside the app itself my led notifications are back!   Hope this helps anyone who is having the same issue I had!
 - June 27, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.2&&&does not work at all&&&I uninstalled the application after crashing for many times and reinstall it again, how can i get refund ?
 - June 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Fabulous!&&&Essential app for Galaxy Nexus. No issues at all, even after update. Stock unrooted GN LTE 4.0.4.
 - June 23, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Update Screwed It Up&&&The new UI is great... but a previously perfect app is noe giving me all sorts of audio problems. Its really a shame.
 - June 24, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Just get the LITE version&&&The program is great. Google should have implemented all those features in Android.  But the program drains battery soooo much. If you want a basic blinking (missed calls, sms) - just get the LITE version and you'll be fine. This version adds LED blinking for various app notifications (fb, skype etc.). And more apps you add - LF drains your battery more. With this app I need to charge my phone - twice (instead of one time).
 - June 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 3.0.2&&&Worth the money&&&At first the app wasn't working and the led notifications would only work half the time. Then I changed some settings on go SMS and this app works like a dream. I love it! Best app out there! Worth the money for the full version!
 - June 30, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 3.0.2&&&Cincinnati&&&Not responsive all the time. Check out the problem on the Droid Razor Maxx. It cool when it does response to the txt, low battery etc.
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Perfect!&&&Was convinced after trying the free app for a day or so purchased the full version of the app!
 - June 26, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Intermittent after last update.&&&LED sometimes will not flash for set notifications after the last update. New UI is greatly improved but functionality needs to be fixed.
 - June 29, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.2&&&Great app, some issues with latest update.&&&I use this app mainly to control notifications on work emails. Does the job and works great. I love the flexibility of the vibration settings. Some issues with the last update though.     Notifications that were vibrate/light only would not work until I activated sound, changed the sound to ‘silent’, the deactivated it again.    The major issue is these same notifications now cause my music players to pause. Since I listen to these during the work day, it happens a lot! Update: This only happens if you have no sound on your notification.  (Galaxy S2 Epic 4G Touch)
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Best app I've ever paid for&&&For all those giving it 1 and 2 stars because you're having trouble after an update, why don't you just contact the dev and see what a little customer service can do instead of slandering an awesome app's reputation. I too had problems when I updated to 4.0.4, but the latest version of lightflow works perfectly. Verizon GN.
 - June 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 3.0.2&&&Great app!&&&Absolutely love this app! The only problem I have is that it  notifies Gmail and all other emails together.  Would very much like notification light for each email account instead of just the two.
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.2&&&Good support&&&Previous updated broke I9300 and submitted a ticket and developer fixed it within the day. Thanks for the help!
 - June 21, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.2&&&Only green and white light?&&&Was only getting green and white notifications. Tried reboot, same deal. Tried uninstall/re-install, now I'm only getting green... sounds like a result of a recent update (from other reviews).  Ultimate bummer.  2 stars because I love the concept and really look forward to the correction.  Please fix?  SGS3.
 - June 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Please update for 4.1 Jelly Bean&&&Just updated my galaxy nexus to the latest Android OS 4.1 Jelly Bean and light flow isn't quite working properly. Hope to see a fix soon!
 - June 29, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Update killed everything. Tried disabling/inabling. Reboot, nada&&&
 - June 21, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.2&&&Works, Causes Strangeness with Volume Ducking&&&Works just as intended, get my lovely vibration patterns and custom LED colors. However, I've noticed that while streaming Music to my Bluetooth headset via Google Music, the volume will fade down (duck) to play a notification sound, but fail to fade back up afterward, leaving the music playing quietly in the background. This does not occur when Light Flow is disabled. Hope to see this fixed soon so I don't have to disable Light Flow when I'm playing my music!
 - June 29, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.2&&&does not work properly..yet&&&Rogers GS III. green LED comes on when screen is off, notification LEDS are not the colours I chose and do not blink.hope u have a fix for these soon.
 - June 20, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Problems after update&&&One of my favorite apps, but it abruptly stopped working after the newest 3.0 updates.  I've tried rebooting multiple times and playing with settings, but nothing has worked. I'm using a GSM galaxy nexus
 - June 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Awsome&&&I love this app. Totally worth the money.  Makes the notification like perfect only Galaxy Nexus.  Developer responds to issues in emails.   Great developer.
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Must have&&&A must have if your phone has a multi-color notification LED. It's the best by a mile, and the new GUI makes it a breeze to setup and configure.
 - June 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.2&&&Very good upgrade to what comes with Android.&&&I really like the options and full set of apps that can be configured with this.  However on the rare occasion it flat out doesn't work. I'll get an audible tone of a new email and no light or other missed light notification. Its very rare and I'm sure its part of the normal app improvements.   That's really the only reason its 4 out of 5 stars as its very very good, but not perfect.  I'd also like to see a better global change feature in the options. As an example, the default is to blink the light. I don't like that and want a constant light. Currently I have to go into each and every app I have linked to this and change that setting. The app really needs a global setting change to something like this that exists as an option to every app you have set to be notified by in Light Flow.
 - June 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Great app.... just one request!&&&And that is to enable custom notifications for different contacts in applications such as whatsapp etc. When that's here I would give it 10 stars if that was possible
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Amazing&&&I normally dislike writing reviews but after this recent update, I feel obligated to do so.  This app has seriously changed the way I use my phone in an amazing way. The customization of every notification is brilliant. I never need to turn on my phone to know what's going on. Almost all the 'big' apps are supported and more seem to be added continuously.  The new update has a layout which makes navigating the app a snap. I can easily now tell the type of notification and the color of each app on one page
 - June 29, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.2&&&good, but...&&&would be a great app if there were no talkback bug... please fix this
 - July 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Having a bug.&&&I recently updated my Galaxy Nexus to Jelly Bean. Never had a problem with light flow before but now quite often the notification light never gets cleared. So even after both clearing the notification from the pull down and reading the notification in the app it continues to blink. Thanks for being a help full!
 - June 29, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Good app, but broken for android 4.1&&&Does not work for android jellybean. Rooted with supersu
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&LOVE it&&&Seriously, just get it. I get comments and compliments about the LED on my GNex all the time.
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&EXCELLENT!!&&&Excellent app, BUT latest update wiped my notifications and I missed critical messages today.  not a happy camper :(  :(
 - June 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.2&&&Love it.&&&It's turned my new Galaxy S3 into a veritable notification Christmas tree.
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Just works.&&&When you go through your settings and turn off the phones notifications and let light flow take over, it works perfect.
 - June 25, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 3.0.2&&&Can't turn off sound.&&&I love this app but with the recent update I can't turn off sound. I uncheck it but I still get double notifications.
 - June 21, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Great app but...&&&but stopped working after recent major update and still doesn't work after most recent bug fix update.  Have tried uninstall/reinstall, reboots, still a no go.  Thought it was running in foreground so I turned that off. Now they seem to work except Google Talk.
 - June 22, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Waste of money&&&It displays lights when there are no notifications. I was hoping the new version might fix it, but no. Wish I never bought it.
 - June 24, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.2&&&Was nice while it worked&&&Having issues with it on Galaxy S III.  Random colors staying on, incorrect colors being displayed, the phone announcing when folders are opened & closed.
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Full featured&&&Does everything I needed. I also requested an additional program added and the response was great. Just added to the next release. Full marks.
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Awesome new UI!&&&Really dig the custom settings per individual Contact!
 - June 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Must Have&&&This is great for any phones with tri-color LEDs. I wish functionality like this was built in, but thankfully we have his app to help out. It's a little wacky on Android 4.1, but it's too soon to complain =)
 - June 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Awesome&&&The only thing that I could think to make this app any better is if it was possible to use multiple colors for 1 notification
 - June 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.2&&&Great must have addon for the GS3&&&This was my first ever purchase of a mobile app, and love it.  It took me a little to find what settings my GS3 preferred, As different hardware requires different config it is difficult for the app builder to preset some features..  so after a little trial and error it has been great.. just started with a few to get the feel before i went crazy and added a million light flash combos..  Why i love it..  i can screen my notifications without picking up my phone. light flow allows me to see what app has given the notification and then i choose if i will stop what i am doing to check it..   Maybe if more people used the paid version the app builder could build in set up profiles configured for the most commonly used settings, to save some people the trial and error set up
 - June 24, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Not working after the update&&&The application is not giving notification after the update. Please fix this. Was working fine before.
 - June 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Great!&&&Works perfectly on my Galaxy Nexus with ICS. Please update for Jelly Bean, as the notification light does not turn off without opening the light flow app.

 - June 21, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 3.0.2&&&Needs work&&&Stops working after last bunch of updates, after turning off, then on accessablity. Only way to get it to work is to open it from the google store app. In the mean time,  NO notifications at all. Pls fix!

 - June 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Doesn't play nice with Jelly Bean&&&The LED doesn't stop as expected with Jelly Bean. This is likely to do with the new notification system. JB is just two days old though so I won't hold it against you.

 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.2&&&Fantastic App and Dev.&&&This app is absolutely incredible. Even if your phone doesn't have LED, the app allows you to set sounds & vibrations for most of the popular apps on the market. 5 stars ain't enough!

As Jelly Bean hasn't even started being updated OTA, I'm hoping this will get fixed in the next update. Otherwise, I still love the app, it's the most useful app I think I've ever installed on my phone!

 - July 5, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.2&&&Leaks with ICS&&&This is a really good app, but it doesn't play well with ICS on RAZR MAXX. The lights are sticky after SMS and Email notifications, and I've detected a HUGE ROM leak. It would cause my ROM to go below 100MB, and it would severely cramp my system. I did purge about half my apps (100 or so), including Light Flow, and the problem disappeared. Reinstalled Light Flow without activating it, and the leak was back. After I uninstalled it, the problems went away. But I love this app and hope it can be fixed.
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.1&&&Great Update!&&&I had uninstalled the app and am now a user again (and a fan). Lots of great new options, great layout, great function, and great design. Works perfectly on Galaxy Nexus.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Fixed now&&&Quick response from dev who fixed the bugs. No more white led problem. App is back to working great!
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&A Galaxy Nexus MUST!&&&Exactly what I needed for notifications.
 - June 20, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 3.0.1&&&Uninstall update&&&Wish I could uninstall update. Lightflow symbol stays in my notification bar. last version no notification in status bar.ie: while phone is charging if I try to clear it, it shuts the led off
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.1&&&Easily worth the money.&&&Provided you have a multicolored led phone.  I have a Galaxy Nexus and its excellent.  Google should buy this from them and bake it into Android.
 - June 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&One more set of features & then perfection&&&The ability to save sets of notifications and switch between these profiles would be great...like with a toggle widget in a notification toolbar or power off menu.  Seems like we're going in that direction already. Thanks for the great app so far!
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.1&&&Wow&&&Loved this app at version 2.x, but just downloaded the update... love it even more.  Stellar improvements in the GUI, and everything else keeps on rocking as usual.  Well worth twice the asking price.
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Best app ever!&&&I love this app! Just what I needed to make my GN perfect. Now I never miss a notification and can just glance at what color led is flashing.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.1&&&Don't miss it!&&&This app is a must. Super useful! Works well on Galaxy S3
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Superb&&&This app was excellent before the UI redesign, it is not only extremely functional but now very easy on the eye!
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Great!&&&This app makes the Galaxy Nexus notification light actually useful and the new layout looks great!
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Nice update&&&... And thanks for the swift bug fixes!  This is still my most essential application on the Galaxy Nexus.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.1&&&Awesome!&&&Dev has been most friendly with all feedback. Saves me wonders with the notification lights. Now loving the new UI and DrawSomething inclusion. Just too good!!
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.1&&&Fantastic. Outstanding support&&&No words: so many options let you do whatever you want. ...and the developer showed an outstanding support and very fast response!  absolutely advised: a must have app on every led-compatible android phone.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.1&&&Fast response&&&Dev fixed bug quickly and efficiently!
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Previously worked fine&&&White led issue fixed, thanks!
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Constant LED Bug&&&I still have the white blinking led even after restarting my phone. Galaxy Nexus LTE. Otherwise great application
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Definitely worth the money...&&&Tons of options, developers are super responsive. I've read through a bunch of reviews here, and 99% of problems are due to users failing to carefully choose the best settings for their device. Battery drain is negligible IMO. Rare issues with lights not coming on or staying on, usually when multiple things are happening, but normally reliable. RAM issues go away with reboot, and usually stay low (<20mb). Galaxy Nexus LTE
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&A must have for phones with a notification LED&&&One of the most useful apps I have. Should have been part of the OS. Works well on my GNex.  The Lite version supports only a limited number of apps and suppresses the notification light for unsupported apps, so it's useful only as an evaluation. The commercial version supports so many apps that this is not an issue. Definitely worth the money.  New UI for ICS is very well organized and is so much better than the previous version. Kudos to the developers. 5 stars!
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid 3 &&& 3.0.1&&&Great app!&&&Works great. Love this app!  Please add notification support for Godville. Thx!
 - June 19, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Stopped working&&&Led notification stopped working since update, have done two resets. Using a led tester app fails as well if LF is installed. When uninstalling LF the led tester works. UI does look awesome now.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&On board to support DEV&&&Tried the free version, whatever issues I had were quickly resolved with an instant reply (Sunday evening mind you). I have a Galaxy Nexus and this is a must have app.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Love the new update&&&Essential app if you have a Galaxy Nexus.

 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Developers get it&&&This app is proof that with the right developers anything is possible with android. Great UI makeover and even better functionality!

 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Great App!&&&I can't live without this app on my galaxy nexus now. It has completely changed how I interact with notifications and my phone. Amazing ICS update!
 - June 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&A basic necessity&&&One of the most important apps for any phone with a multi colored LED, this app works flawlessly.
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Looks Great!&&&Nice job on the updated look. Easily a 5 star app. Works great on my Nexus. Please add aCalendar/aCalendar+.
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Awesome&&&This is a must have for Galaxy Nexus users
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Easy to use.&&&Great app that I've never had a problem with. The new look makes it even easier to use. Must have on the Galaxy Nexus.

 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Galaxy Nexus&&&Perfect app for the VZW Galaxy Nexus to control the notification LED.  Absolutely love the new layout!
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Great dev&&&And new design is awesome!
 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.1&&&Wow... love it&&&What an update. It brought a new and beautiful interface..

 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Excellent&&&Does what it says. Love the UI overhaul too.
 - June 20, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.1&&&Galaxy S III&&&5 stars if there is an option to change blinking led sequence
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Love the new UI&&&This app works great on the galaxy nexus, and is a must have for any phone with a multicolored notification light.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Works great on my Galaxy Nexus&&&
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Awesome&&&Man this update is great. Beautiful!
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&New interface is great&&&So grateful for this app!
 - June 19, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.1&&&May be an issue that's SGS3 GT-I9300 specific&&&Must have notification vibration enabled under system settings for vibration settings to work in light flow. 2 problems with this: 1) You get two different vibrations when a notification triggers: Default one from the system and the one from light flow. 2) If you turn off notification vibrations under system settings, then the light flow vibrations do not trigger at all.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Awesome app&&&This app works perfectly on my Galaxy Nexus and the new UI update is perfection. Well done
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Wow&&&New layout is amazing!!
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Galaxy Nexus must have&&&Love this app! Excellent customer support. The new update is amazing!

 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.1&&&Awesome update.&&&Superb. Didn't notice much of a battery drain.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.0&&&Top Notch App&&&An absolute necessity if you own a Galaxy Nexus.  The newest update with the ability to change volume notification separately from the system is awesome.  Also, I love the addition of clearing the LED notification if you clear it from the notification bar.  I like the new ICS layout as well.  Best app I've purchased for my GN.
 - June 19, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&White light will not shut off.&&&I have rebooted the phone and the issue has not gone away. Please fix.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Can't get white light to turn off&&&Galaxy Nexus 4.04
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Vast improvement&&&Great update. Loving the new UI. Glad I upgraded to the paid version. Keep up the good work.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.0&&&Bravo!&&&How bout a round of applause for the devs! This is how you design an app for ICS! Such a useful, easy to use utility that enables more granular control over notifications. The menus could (still) be a bit clearer, but really I'm just picking nits ;) If you have a Galaxy Nexus--rooted or stock--then you need this app. (Galaxy Nexus)
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Great ICS update!&&&Also love how I can adjust LED cycle and flash rate. New idea: maybe able to save a certain config as a Category (Games, IMs, etc) that can be quickly applied to a new app instead of having to re enter the config.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 3.0.0&&&Awesome Product!&&&This app makes my life so much better by letting me know with the color of the LED if I have a stressful work email, or pleasant game of Draw Something waiting for me.
 - June 19, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&What the hell happened?&&&Love this app, but it looks all messed up now. What was wrong with the old interface? It was simple and easy. This just blows big time!
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Amazing control over notifications&&&Not only does this let you take full advantage of three color LEDs, it allows granular control over all aspects of notifications. Absolutely essential!
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.0&&&Awesome!&&&EDIT: I really should learn to read the WHOLE overview section. To people with the continuous white flashing notification after upgrading: Restart your phone after the upgrade. To the developer, maybe move that important info up a bit in the overview section! =)
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Great app&&&Love the update.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.0&&&Great update, amazing app.&&&Great application.  It works perfect, has great customization options, and with the new update the UI is snazzy as hell and easy to use.  You WILL NOT find a better app for LED and notification light control.  Worth double it's price.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Holy hell!&&&What an update! This app went from being a must have to a beautiful must have app! 5* to the dev!
 - June 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Terrific!&&&Very useful and now totally re-skinned, awesome.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Love the update&&&Love the update.. Easy to use.. Very ICS Friendly..
 - June 19, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.0&&&Still no hookt ?&&&Why not?! It says hookt is supported what's going on?
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&awesome app keeps getting better&&&works great and looks great after the update I'm really liking the new ui - galaxy nexus running aokp
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Quality!&&&The latest update has taken this must have app to a totally new level. If you have a notification LED get this app. Don't think about it, get it.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Amazing update&&&Brilliant ui now that is 4.0 inspired
 - June 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&The new UI Rocks&&&Thanks for the update
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Phenomenal&&&This is a must-have, especially for Nexus owners. Amazing features and wonderful support make this an instant buy. Set it up and love it forever.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Must have for Galaxy Nexus!&&&
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Wow!&&&Version 3.0 is visually fantastic! What a massive improvement! Much more user friendly and more options that ever! One of my all time top favorite apps!
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&A must for the Galaxy Nexus&&&It works exactly like it should. The only thing I'd want is support for more apps (especially Instagram) even though there are already numerous.
 - June 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Wow...EPIC update!&&&
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Awesome.&&&Great app, love the new UI! Great job guys.
 - June 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.0&&&Perfect!&&&New UI is sheer class - makes an already great app even better.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Awesome update!&&&Been using this since day one with my LTE Galaxy Nexus. Works great and the new UI layout is very user friendly.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&ICS&&&Great job on the new user interface. Flows well with stock ice cream sandwich.
 - June 19, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 3.0.0&&&Drain battery&&&And answer from developer is to read faq.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&A+&&&Brilliant redesign.

 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Great Update&&&Been using the app for about 6 months now. The update is top notch.
 - June 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.0&&&New update is sexy!!!&&&Love the new interface and finally notifications for draw something and dice with buddies. Very awesome and supportive developer!!
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Wow! Great upgrade!&&&Love the 3.0 update. Very nicely done!!!
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 3.0.0&&&Good app, useful. Can you support led for Youlu Adress Book, sms notifications?&&&
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.0&&&Great app&&&beautiful update, works great, and responsive developer what more could you ask for!
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&The very best&&&The new interface has made this app the best there is in my opinion. All it needs now is a widget for the volume controls.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Indispensable&&&This is how Android apps should be. Great features and updates too!
 - June 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.0&&&Impressive&&&Get the light version and you'll be hooked Worth buying
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Nice!&&&'Epic' is right!

 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&New&&&Version is awesome
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Great - suggestion below&&&Needs ability to add customized notifications from different contacts in the supported social apps, not just phone contacts, who even uses SMS anymore anyways
 - June 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Arc &&& 2.12.5&&&Great, however doesn't work on ICS&&&This was one of the first apps installed on my arc and one of most important ones. Unfortunately once I upgraded to official sony android 4.0.4 (ice cream sandwich / ICS) ligthtflow lost ability to control led due to the ICS led control issue (the led isn't powered while the device screen is off)... -- this should be added to the known limits section of the app overview.
 - April 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Great app but...&&&Its a great app. Works as advertise, but there's one thing I wish the developer would app and that is if there are two different kind of notification and if I swipe only one notification, it still shows the notification light for the app that I swipe from the notification bar. Please fix that so that if I swipe one notification from notification bar and leave other one in there, the one that I swipe off should also clear the notification light. I would appreciate if you app this in the next update.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 3.0.0&&&Love the update !&&&
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Fantastic app&&&
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Galaxy nexus user&&&Beautiful and brilliant
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 3.0.0&&&Must have app&&&
 - April 21, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Works well&&&I want a "rainbow" mode where it flashes once with a sequence of the notification colors (for example Gmail, SMS and Skype in a sequence and then off for 5 seconds), would be more informative and look awesome
 - March 21, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 2.12.5&&&??&&&Worked great till recent update. Now the light continues to blink even after checking all notifications. Only way to stop it is to kill it via task manager & then re-enable it in accessibility. Droid RAZR.
 - June 11, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 2.12.5&&&Almost perfect&&&Would be 5 stars but seems to be a bug for the s3.when you turn lightflow on in accessibility every time you open and close a folder it actually speaks "folder open" and "folder close".. Think enabling lightflow enables something else in accessibility
 - March 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Amazing&&&Works perfect so customizable it's unbelievable.. Not just for customizing led flash but also vibration and notifications to individual contacts. Galaxy nexus gsm
 - May 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 2.12.5&&&Fantastic!&&&My phone doesn't have an led, but I use this for repeating audio alerts (for email, sms, whatsapp, missed calls, etc).  It's great, highly customizable, reliable, and doesn't drain the battery!  Highly recommended.
 - May 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Essential&&&This is a must have app. The stock ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich) notifications are a joke compared to Light Flow.  One small improvement would be nice though: notification support for "unknown" apps. I mean it'd be nice if users would not have to depend on whether Light Flow "supports" an app or not. I guess that Light Flow could listen for all notifications (that appear in the notification bar) and users could set up rules for unknown apps too. I don't know if this is feasible at all, but it'd be definitely nice. Eg. I use Jorte calendar and Light Flow does not yet support it.
 - March 28, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Cool colors&&&Seems good and it works on my nexus lte....but it seems like Google could easily of added this in for free. The one thing I'm not sure about is when I look in my running apps...this app is at 36mb.  It makes lights flash...seems like it should be way lower. Hope this doesn't turn into a needless battery killer.
 - June 18, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.5&&&Awesome, but...&&&This is an excellent idea, but app won't work correctly while in Google Car Home.  Light flashes when screen is first turned off, and notifications don't push through only while in Google Car Home.  Otherwise, app is brilliant.  Will give 5 starts as soon as dev fixes.    Samsung Galaxy Nexus i-515, rooted, stock 4.0.4 rom, franco.kernel Milestone4
 - April 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Super Useful&&&This application is one of the most useful on my phone. Fixed a major frustration; now texts and emails and everything has its own color and blink rate. Works 100% on my VZ GNex.
 - March 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Awesome App, Superb Support!&&&I've been using this app for month and absolutely love it. It's perfect for having my phone on my desk at work so I can see when I get an email/text/whatever without having to have the ringer on.    When I had to do a reinstall of the app, I was having some difficulty returning the settings to the same way they were before. I contacted the dev team for support and got a reply in under a minute! I've never seen that kind of response anywhere else.    Defs a must-have for the Galaxy Nexus! Top notch app.
 - May 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Mostly works&&&This doesn't work if I wasn't to use notifications for enhanced email on my galaxy nexus, only red and blue work?
 - June 13, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Great when it works&&&I have a Galaxy Nexus and this has not worked smoothly at all.  Sometimes it will blink while charging and sometimes won't.  It just works when it feels like it.  Then there are times where it will blink pink and there are no notifications.  I don't even have pink set as a color for anything.  The real lousy thing is it will blink pink even if you get a text or call.  It take priority away and there is no way to stop it.  On the occasions when it works it is nice though.
 - May 5, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Good however,&&&whenever the screen times out by itself, the light comes back on as it should, but when I turn the screen back on they continue. Please fix! Also, please add support for Draw Something. Finally, it seems to have a bit of trouble cycling light colors, getting a bit "stuck" sometimes.
 - June 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Solid&&&Every now and then the notification light keeps blinking even after the notification has been dismissed. But overall superb on galaxy nexus. Flight track added! Thank you!
 - April 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Pretty good&&&This app would be excellent if there was an option to delete notifications by swiping away in the menu
 - March 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.5&&&Cool&&&Works perfectly on my Galaxy Nexus GSM. This makes ICS complete! I always missed the bright notification LED on my old Blackberry; well, not anymore! thank you. The only Con I would think of are the menus. They are a bit confusing and crowded.
 - April 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Galaxy Nexus LTE&&&Before this app, I didn't even know that the notification light was capable of RGB. With this I can finally know whether I've got an SMS, Gmail, Talk, or specifically anything before even turning on the screen thanks to the different and even custom colors I've got for each. Worth the $2 and then some. Love it!
 - June 2, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 2.12.5&&&One irritating thing...&&&Would be five stars but when I open or close a folder is says "Folder open" or "Folder close", even in silent mode. Please fix this! Other than this is brilliant! Great app!
 - June 9, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Does not always work, no updates&&&I have just downgraded this app.. No update in a long time to fix issues with reliability.. Had contacted the Dev and got a reply but still waiting on update.. If an update for 5 stars....This is a great app and was worth the money but I'd pay triple if it would always work. Not all notifications are picked up as in it sometimes fails to pick up on events. failures are real random, if I restart the app it usually helps.. But does not guarantee it. Please make reliable and I will give 5 stars
 - May 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.5&&&Works&&&Should be bundled with the GNex. It gives you control of your LED indicator, colours, pulse etc. It just works.
 - March 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Must have app for galaxy nexus&&&Google should really add this application right into settings... In other words this should come stock. Fortunately we have this fantastic app to satisfy our color notification needs.
 - May 3, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Not consistent&&&Lights don't consistently blink with monitored apps. Galaxy Nexus, stock
 - June 23, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Serviceable&&&Enhancement on ice cream sandwich however does not stop light on messages cleared through the notification menu only and causes some apps, such as google books, to read via text to speech.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Awesome&&&I love Light Flow, so much that I can't bare to stop using my Galaxy Nexus and give up the multi-color LED even though I also have a EVO LTE 4G.
 - April 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Very nice.&&&Works great. Need 2min notification remind time. Also need support for Scramble With Friends(paid version) and Draw Something.
 - June 26, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.5&&&New Update Issues&&&I am using the lite version from day one of my entry to android. Now, purchased the paid one and completely satisfied by the amount of customization it gives. Only issue is with Nimbuzz where lot of false notifications are coming up. 5 Stars if this is fixed.  EDIT: The latest update is ruining the experience. UI was a welcome change. But now it FC's. Sometimes take up lion share of my battery. Please fix it soon.
 - June 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Love it!&&&Fell in love with the LED notification and this app works great! Every time a minor issue came up the developer responded immediately with a solution.
 - March 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Excellent application&&&Love this application it brings the only good thing in blackberry to Android!
 - June 26, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.5&&&It is a great app when it works&&&After the most recent update many of my notifications are not consistent anymore. I hope it's fixed in a newer release and then I will give 5 stars.
 - June 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.5&&&Let there be light&&&Exactly what I need - I don't even need to pick up my phone now to see what I missed - the colours tell me from across the room - AWESOME!  Works perfectly on the Galaxy S3, and the sleep mode is the best feature!
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Update: Even better!&&&Fantastic Brilliant app with great support from developer. Has become an integral part of my Galaxy Nexus experience. UPDATE: The new design is brilliant. Dev has done a great job sticking to ICS guidelines but making a distinctive app.
 - April 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Fantastic&&&Fantastic application. Its a little touchy sometimes. A good application anyway and highly recommended. Responsive support.
 - June 12, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Cool app&&&This is a cool app. Everything works the way it shuld and i never really have a problem with it. I just hate the fact that it comes with google talkback pre-installed. Idk who's idea it was to add that in as a feature but its f*ckin annoying to have an automated voice read everything u do, type, or search.  This app would b alot better without the talkback feature. I also think this app culd use more notification sounds too, so you don't end up using the same sound for 5 different apps
 - March 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Love it!&&&Only thing missing for me is contact specific notifications for gtalk and whatsapp! Thanks a lot for your efforts in this amazing product.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Excelente Aplicacion&&&... Definitivamente vale cada peso que pague, es muy "cool" y te facilita mucho saber que pasa sin prender el celular!!!
 - May 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Galaxy Nexus Friendly&&&Works very well but app got "stuck" when accidental battery pull happened. LED went nuts and and my Gnex went dead in three hours with the siedio 3800mah batt- which had been at full charge. Phone was hot as hell even though I hadn't used it at all. If this happens uninstall light flow app, restart phone, reinstall. Tip of the sword is fun huh?
 - May 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Fantastic App&&&So I was looking for an app to be able to change led notification light and after trying out a couple this was by far the best one. And not that this helps you but the color selection that had been pre selected was great! Definitely a great app. Also acts as a system app so no clutter.
 - March 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia S &&& 2.12.5&&&Works Perfectly&&&One improvement I would like to see in the future - To have an option for flashing on the 'Button Backlight LED' Would look awesome on the Xperia S. Solid light looks good atm but flashing would perfect it!
 - June 22, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&White light?&&&Eats battery and doesn't work right
 - May 2, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X2 &&& 2.12.5&&&I would give it a 0&&&Garbage, it doesn't even work on Droid X2 i think it would b a great app, IF I COULD USE IT.
 - June 10, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.5&&&Four Star Application on E4GT...&&&...but really that application is even more than I expected the application to be.  I mostly used Handcent SMS for a couple years because of Androids short comings in Contact Specific Ringtones for Messages and selecting a specific LED color.  This application lets me set the LEDs so that Messages have a different color/pattern than the other functions/notifications and it also lets me change settings per user for Messages.  Only issue I have found is that while Handcent would allow the selection of Green for the LED which would in turn actually display a purple (using Red and Blue at the same time).  I seem to only be able to achieve the Purple/Pink color using the Direct Mode Option and than the Mixer.  However, when using Direct Mode the White Option (Allows for a Fast Flashing Red LED) goes away.  So, either way I only have three options available instead of the Four Options the Phone will actually support.
 - May 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&I can't live without you...&&&one of my absolute 'must-have' apps for my nexus. once you've got all the settings dialed in, it changes the way you use your phone. so many options and customization to choose from, if it works on your phone or if you have a galaxy nexus, buy this. do it. now.
 - April 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Download now!&&&This app let's you manage all notifications in one place. The colored LED alerts take me back to my BB days and make distinguishing notifications simple.
 - May 2, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Love it.&&&My only complaint is the calendar notification bug which the dev is obviously aware of. Definitely recommend.
 - June 18, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Necessity&&&If you have a phone with a LED then this is a must have. Most of the kinks have been ironed out and this is now a solid app.
 - June 21, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.5&&&Latest update borked it&&&Notification sounds continually and there is no way to shut it off. Also seems to cause phone to become unresponsive. Too bad, I had been giving it 5 stars.
 - April 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Very good and functional&&&Very useful app to fully utilize various colors of notification LED light.  Latest update seems to have improved vastly on memory usage as well as fixed some minor random bugs.  Now it works seamlessly and with its endless customization it works just the way I like it.  Definitely a service that should be integrated into android.
 - June 11, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 2.12.5&&&good app but is a battery killer&&&using this application has dramatically reduced my battery life on my galaxy s3 might be that I doubt have the settings right but puts still a battery killer
 - May 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.5&&&Very useful!&&&Been using the Lite version for a few months now on my Galaxy Nexus. Worth the $1.99 for an app I use every day.
 - June 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 2.12.5&&&Fantastic!&&&Well worth the money. App and customer service are amazing!
 - March 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Amazing Dev&&&Great application, supported by a very professional and active developer.  Totally worth paying for.  Google should have included this in Android.  Galaxy Nexus
 - May 23, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.5&&&Support is slipping&&&The developer used to be all over a bug reports and offered quick fixes.  This doesn't seem to be the case anymore.  Miss-labeled settings continue, version after version.  Contact specific notifications haven't worked properly since the option was added.  Sounds that don't match the settings happen randomly.  Maybe he is too busy to fix them.
 - June 17, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 2.12.5&&&Average&&&I change the notifications in go sms and I end up with two rings and no alerts
 - May 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.5&&&I love it! My favorite app.&&&I installed this on my Galaxy Nexus and couldn't imagine what the phone would be like without it.  Seamless integration with every one of my apps and email accounts, custom contact notifications works perfectly. I love how it cycles the colors when you have multiple notifications. Plenty of color options and my phones notification LED has no trouble displaying the various custom colors I create for my multitude of notifications.  All in all it is brilliant and it has gone beyond a mere 'fun' application to an essential feature of my Galaxy Nexus.
 - April 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Amazing on Galaxy Nexus&&&Tried the lite version- good but really wanted more customization and easily made decision to spend two bucks.
 - June 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Awesome notifications&&&Love being able to set the LED on my Galaxy Nexus on any new event. And the app supports pretty much every messaging app I have.
 - June 8, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.5&&&HTC Rezound&&&Using direct mode, blinking is disabled.
 - April 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Amazing&&&So many notification options. Especially love the MMS one. Takes me back to the dumb phone days that had separate MMS notifications.
 - March 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Great app&&&I've come to rely on having this app on my phone to tell me the kind of message I have waiting, or if my phone has a low battery.
 - May 20, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.5&&&Okay but...&&&Repeating sounds continue to go off even after they've been cleared...
 - June 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 2.12.5&&&Just what I wanted&&&Works great for my phone. Some custom colors don't work but that's expected. All supplied colors work. Most Motorola's can't use all these colors, but the Razr seems to be able to. Loved it so much I bought it.
 - April 6, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.5&&&-1 for having to start manually each boot.&&&Works well, despite my rezound only having two crap colors.  Would easily get 5 stars if the app could automatically start in the background at boot.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 2.12.5&&&New interface is amazing&&&This app is well worth the money!! Cannot recommend enough, the only app I have spent money on and I would suggest everyone else does the same

 - May 30, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 2.12.5&&&Love it&&&But until it uses notification volume and not media, I have to uninstall.
 - June 10, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.5&&&galaxy s3&&&great app! very helpful. Hope you guys fix the SOUND and VIBRATION notifications. sound works but default sound still exist making the notification sound doubled, as for the vibration its not working. waiting for the next update :)
 - March 22, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 2.12.5&&&dosent work&&&cant set any settings, this app is garbage dont waste your money.
 - March 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.5&&&Great app, but not perfect&&&Lots of customizations and  easy to use, but LED doesn't flash 100% of the time.  Randomly texts, emails, etc. wonk blink.  Not sure why.
 - May 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&Amazing app&&&The only thing I would add is a notification for the Draw Something app.

 - June 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&New version is great!&&&This app was already nice, but the new version is fantastic. Being able to see at a glance priority, repeating notifications, and colors without going thru menus is a HUGE improvement!
 - May 30, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 2.12.5&&&Not!&&&I have the Galaxy Note and it doesn't work...disappointed
 - April 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.5&&&Great app for Gnex! with one big wish...&&&Is there anyway the dev could force this app to have the LED notifications active when the screen is on?
 - June 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.5&&&Great apparently and support&&&Just wanted to say not only is this app top notch but the support and help from the developers can't be beat! 5 Stars for sure!!

 - June 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.5&&&must have for all galaxy nexuses (nexii?)&&&incredibly powerful with a moderate learning curve, it really unleashes the gn's led. notification prioritization, the cycling of leds, and choosing any color the gn supports makes this a one of a kind app.
 - May 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 2.12.5&&&Very useful&&&Lots of options. I find it very useful to me. Best of all I can turn off the blinking light while I'm sleeping. My wife thanks you.

 - March 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.5&&&Great app with a little room to grow&&&This app is well worth the money.  I do have a few requests that would make this a 5 star app:  (1) Allow gmail and email notifications with the specific contact notifications  (2) Allow Hex color codes to be entered when selecting LED colors.

Working superb on galaxy nexus. This developer should be making tons of cash as it should come pre-installed on all android devices! Well done and thank you.
 - June 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 2.12.5&&&Absolutely fantastic!&&&One of the best apps there is!
 - March 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 2.12.4&&&Must have on Razr Maxx!!&&&Had lite ver on a Galaxy Nexus & thought Razr Maxx only had white lite. Wound up trying on my Maxx and then buying full ver. LOVE the quick glance to see what notification(s) is/are waiting based on color(s). Shows almost all predefined colors spot on for Razr Maxx. Even white and sky blue. Can't imagine using a smartphone w/o a notification light. iWhat??

 - February 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.4&&&Fantastic app!&&&I rely on this app to bring my otherwise pathetic LED on my Galaxy Nexus to life. It works flawlessly. I love that the LED will flash all different colors for my notifications instead of just flashing one color for the notification that arrived first. Highly recommend!

 - March 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 2.12.4&&&Did exactly what I wanted on my DROID X2&&&Which was keep my light solid, my Droid Razr Maxx can't do that but I decided to purchase the full version because the developers have always been so helpful and its a one of a kind product. Worth the money.
 - March 14, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.4&&&Wonderfully customizable, but...&&&Using Better Better Stats to check alarms that had been waking my phone, LightFlow had 100 times the number of raw alarms that the next highest program had. 100. Is there any way to fix this, or is it an inherent limitation of using the LED like this?  If you care to respond, I'm mrkmrk on xda.
 - March 2, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 2.12.4&&&Galaxy s2- wont work&&&Wont work on my phone. Do i have to root it to control my LED?
 - February 27, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.4&&&Sometimes stucks&&&Works perfectly, but I have noticed one thing, that sometimes gets stuck and flashes LED even when I have read SMS. I'm using GoSMS and I'm on Galaxy Nexus GSM 4.0.2 ARHD ROM. I'm not sure is that GoSMS or Light Flow problem. But I have faced it couple times and had to reboot mobile to stop flashing the LED.
 - March 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Live &&& 2.12.4&&&Amazing&&&What a brilliant app, Sony Ericsson live with Walkman!!! Even can use the Walkman led"!
 - March 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.4&&&Awesome app!&&&Configuration may take some time, but one you finish it, it's the feeling of accomplishment. Thank you for the app!
 - March 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.4&&&Perfect!&&&One of those essential apps (I'm using a Galaxy Nexus) which works flawlessly.
 - March 15, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 2.12.4&&&Does not work with the Galaxy Note!&&&I purchased this app for the Galaxy Note and the LED does not work at all. I wasted my money...if u have the Galaxy Note do not buy this app!
 - February 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.4&&&Works perfectly! (Galaxy Nexus)&&&I love that I can set all my notifications to different colors, then know at a glance, without unlocking my phone, if need to bother checking them. Awesome app!
 - February 25, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.4&&&Good but need.some fix&&&After set value in notification and back to menu nothing. I have to close it and re open this app to set the notification. Galaxy nexus
 - March 1, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.4&&&Eric&&&Works great on my VZW galaxy nexus. Would give 5 stars if it get notifications for Handcent sms.
 - March 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.4&&&Awesome&&&Works perfectly on the Galaxy Nexus. Soooo much customization!
 - March 12, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.4&&&Verizon Galaxy Nexus&&&Works great. Many customization options which allows you to set things up the way YOU want them. It can take some time though and is not for someone who doesn't have patience or a desire to tinker. Works well with add on apps like GTasks after paying for the full version. Many color options available. I would like to see more customization options for LED flash rate.
 - March 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.12.4&&&Incredible, with one Fatal Flaw&&&This app is incredible!! But if your like me and want to sample some of the books that Google now have. You will have trouble. The app needs to have access to accessibility on your device for it to work properly. However due to this your phone will then think that TalkBack is then turned on, and start reading aloud to you. There are a few things you can do to sort this:  1. Stop Reading Aloud - This will disable the Read Aloud option on Google Books but only for that session, as soon as you open the books app again you will have to disable it again.  2. Disable Accessibility for the Light Flow app - This does work somewhat (as all of your notifications still come up and activate), however as Light Flow can then not access some of the information it needs to read, your notifications will sometimes stay on - even when you have 'actioned' the notification.   Looks like until something is sorted with the app itself or the code of the OS, I'm going to have to use Kindle. Or even just have stock notifications (but that won't happen).  Other than that the app is brilliant. Fully customisable and easy to use and set up. SO MANY OPTIONS!! Well worth the money!!

 - March 1, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.4&&&Umm...&&&Please fix the menus... "Notification Color (Notification method/frequency when the phone is on battery)" nonsense like this is POLLUTING your menus. 3 stars, your app is hard to navigate.

 - February 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&The return of LED notifications&&&Great app. custom controls are a little too much at times but looking forward to profiles and templates. you'll enjoy leaving your phone on your desk and finding you have a surprise awaiting you.

 - February 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.1&&&Great but...&&&After updating Market still thinks there us an update available even after clearing cache and data from market and un/reinstalling light flow.
 - February 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Works great on galaxy nexus&&&Always had something like this on my blackberry this is great. Wish you could choose alternating colors for one notification or fast flashes for incoming phone calls though.
 - February 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.0&&&Great app&&&...and even better support!
 - February 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.1&&&Rocks!&&&Love it. Makes my Galaxy Nexus that much better!

I'm still working out the options, because this thing has tons of them. I can replace all other notification apps. LED. Sound. Repeating sound. Just excellent. Really looking forward to seeing this app stick around and get better.
 - February 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.0&&&must have&&&For gnex. I contacted dev about contact issue..and sure enough the fix just came with newest update. Love it!
 - February 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.0&&&Essential functionality&&&Essential functionality if you have a multi-colored LED. Supports many third-party apps. If a notification is not dismissed when you think it should have been, check the "Clear notification style" setting.
 - February 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.12.0&&&Essential&&&It is such a smart and well-executed idea; can't imagine my phone without it.
 - January 20, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Good but ongoing flashing at times&&&It mostly works but there are times when the light keeps flashing after the notification has been cleared and you have to open light glow and then pull down the notification bar for the light to go off. also my Gmail notification light now keeps the light on instead of having it at the pulse rate I chose.   Galaxy nexus.
 - January 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Must have app for Galaxy Nexus owners&&&One of my first purchased app. Simply it works and I can't miss anything important.
 - January 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Great App&&&Absolutely love this app! Really lets you use the LED to its full potential. Galaxy Nexus
 - January 12, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Almost perfect!&&&The application itself is great and does everything I want it to, but it has to run it the background to work (obviously) the problem is that it uses ~67mb of ram
 - January 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Great app for the Galaxy Nexus!!&&&This is a great app for the Galaxy Nexus.  It can be a little confusing at first but it does a lot of different colors. Once you get the hang of it this is a good app.
 - February 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Request&&&Works great on my Galaxy Nexus. Just please add a widget to turn the app off or block all led function with a single push. Would be very useful. And I'd rather it block led function completely so that built in Android notifications can't make the led flash either when I toggle the widget.
 - January 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Not polished but great and powerfully app!&&&Ultimate control over every notification not just LED! Some bugs and phantom notifications are present but app does get improved often as it seems. Worth the money.
 - January 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.11.0&&&take full advantage of your LED!&&&I've been using this app for a few weeks, and after taking some time to understand all of the options, I have it working very reliably and just like I want it. I highly recommend this app, but it will take some work on your part to get it setup. Samsung Galaxy Nexus (GSM version).
 - January 31, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&more than enough customizations!!&&&GNex: I'm a tweak-geek, and i was surprised by how many options each notification setting had. So many infact that if i utilized even half of them it would defeat the purpose of having a notification at all. The blink frequency was my only hang up with this phone, and this app fixed that for me.
 - February 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Nice.&&&LTE Galaxy Nexus. This app does everything it says. No need to keep checking multiple  email accounts, missed calls, and voice messages. Notifications are right there for you with different colored LED's. Different flash speed settings are nice too.
 - February 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&It is what I wanted&&&Coming from blackberry I was missing few essentials,after installing this app I'm missing one less=),and my GNex is more communicative even with screen off. Well worth of money spent
 - January 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Love it on Nexus&&&This app is fantastic on my galaxy nexus and developer is very helpful when you report any issues. Highly recommend it.
 - February 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Good&&&Very good but i want a function to set prio for a specific led action if more led flashes are active
 - January 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 2.11.0&&&...&&&If you have Evo 4G, get root access.  This will open the app's ability to do almost anything you could want.  I LOVE THE WiMax LED CAPABILITY!!  I used it prior to GB and couldn't find an app to control till now.  Gentle on RAM (usually <10MB). Works really well on Evo 4G. Thank you Dev!!
 - January 29, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Good but needs polishing&&&Causes random restarts and there is no way to set a template for new notifications so it takes a long time to setup. G-Nex
 - February 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Great utility&&&This allows me to completely control vibration, sound, and light notification on the Galaxy Nexus without any issues. The interface is a little clunky but still easily usable.
 - February 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 2.11.0&&&Razr&&&Works great on MOTO RAZR.  Wish this was included on phone to start with.  Only issue is MOTO LED does not support Pink and a couple other issues but this is a hardware problem not the app.
 - February 21, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 2.11.0&&&Razr:&&&Awesome. Should be built into Android... Having a few issues where LED keeps blinking until I, for example, actually read my gmail...
 - February 7, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&I dunno.&&&I love the idea. I wish this functionality was built into Android. But this app is deep. Almost too deep. Very complicated. But it works. No doubt about that.
 - February 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Brilliant!&&&By far one of my favourite paid apps. Definitely worth the money. I have a different colour, tone and vibrate pattern for each different type of notifications.
 - February 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Galaxy nexus&&&I love this app. I just installed it on my galaxy nexus the other day and its been amazing. I would love to see support for Steam notifications as well
 - June 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 2.11.0&&&Galaxy S3&&&Needs to be updated for S3 and then I'm sure it will work just fine once again. Check web page for updates.
 - February 20, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Awesome app&&&Decent app. Wish the calendar light worked as it is the most important. Its a shame cause this app would have been great. Still has some issues to iron out with ICS but a great app and would have gotten 5 stars if the calendar worked. There is phenominal support from dev so hopefully it will be fixed soon can't wait. Highly recommended with galaxy nexus.
 - January 14, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Not in sync with website&&&Good app but the website lists more apps it works with then it actually does. Eg, web lists words with friends but paid app doesn't have it under additional apps.
 - January 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Great&&&Made my GNexus even more awesome :-) doesn't need root!
 - March 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Awesome app!&&&Works great on my Galaxy Nexus...now I know if it's important to check my phone or not. Thanks!
 - January 22, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Galaxy Nexus&&&Lite worked fine, but this doesn't work 50% of the time even when allowed to run as root as it asks for.
 - February 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Works great&&&I had to reset the phone in order to make it work but is works great now. No complains. I could personalize different colors ans tones and vibration for each app. It is awesome. I would definitely recommend the app.
 - February 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Awesome app for Galaxy Nexus&&&This app takes advantage of all the colors the Galaxy Nexus LED has, without it the Nexus only uses default colors, white, red, and green.
 - January 16, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Great addition for the Galaxy Nexus&&&Allows me to customize notifications and the pulse light. Must try out if you depend on led notifications!
 - February 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Sehr praktisch&&&Echt sinnvolle App für das SGN.
 - January 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Great app!&&&Does what is says it supposed to do. That's all I ask. Galaxy Nexus.
 - January 14, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Causes TTS bug&&&This app is causing a TTS bug on GNex.  TTS starts speaking in random apps until I uninstall or disable this app. 2 stars because it's  really friggin annoying.
 - January 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 2.11.0&&&Perfect&&&Works great on Sprint gs2
 - February 7, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 2.11.0&&&Samsung galaxy S2&&&Far as I can tell this app does NOT WORK on my phone!!!
 - February 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&Invaluable&&&This app is a must if you have a galaxy nexus.
 - January 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.11.0&&&totally customise notifications&&&this is handy even without an led... can do per-contact settings and repeating alerts to make sure you notice certain things!
