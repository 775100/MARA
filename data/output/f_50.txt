 - March 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 7.0&&&Great wallpaper (Galaxy Nexus)&&&I'd pay even twice as much for it. Only small issue I have is the compatibility w/ Go Launcher (I think). When you wrap around from the 'first' home panel to the 'last', the wallpaper doesn't readjust its position properly. Developer: I can provided a better explanation if you're interested. Not a big deal though.
