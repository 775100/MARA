 - March 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.0&&&Perfect for Work&&&Best money spent on an app.  Makes my tablet a work tool for grab-and-go to meetings knowing my files are invisibly synchronized between my PC and Nook Color.
 - May 12, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 2.0&&&Works great&&&But could be better.  Subtracting a star for settings that are either missing, or global when they should be syncpair-specific, like hidden file setting, file size limit, and file type limits. The filter can only do so much.  Still,  awesome app
 - April 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 2.0&&&Great app&&&Transformer T101 ~ As a PC user I think that this app is great value for the money. I think that Android user are spoilt.  Does what it states on the tin and then some. BRAVO!!! Wish all apps were this good.
 - April 11, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 2.0&&&Excellent!  Needs Minor Tweaks:&&&Overall excellent.  Only needs to allow filtering (lots of errors for meta like thumbs.db) and delta/block copy mode.
 - April 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.0&&&Perfect&&&Worth every cent.  Simple to use.  Keeps my Phone, two tablets, two Laptops in sync.  Every document I create or edit is automatically available on all my devices.  DropBox is now fully integrated into my Digital world.  Thank you TTXAPPS
 - May 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 2.0&&&This completely makes dropbox usable on android&&&This is the first and likely only application I will ever buy. I saw it went on sale and had to jump on it. The official dropbox app is crap without this addition. This makes your phone REALLY 2-way sync, and not just upload to dropbox! Sugarsync has similar capabilities in its official app, but it's horribly made and constantly syncs files that have not been modified. Thank you!!!
 - April 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 2.0&&&Works beautifully!&&&Works very well, immediate upload of altered files. Love it!
 - March 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.0&&&Expensive, but worth it&&&I'd never advocate spending this much money for a single application, let alone one that offers a feature that can easily be replaced by the developers of the original app, but this is worth every penny. It works flawlessly, is completely transparent, and is dead fast. As for the feature being replaced by Dropbox someday, after struggling with the miserable Android client, I can be assured that there is no way that the Dropbox developers have a chance of replacing this featureset. Purchase away.
 - April 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 2.0&&&Great App for On the Go Development&&&I use this app all the time for web development. All of my web projects are stored on dropbox and sync between my computer and tablet for coding when I am out and about. Sometimes it does seem to stop syncing when there are large numbers of changed/added files, but it starts again at the next scheduled sync period. Overall, a must have app for anyone who uses dropbox.
 - March 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 2.0&&&Great but pay attention during setup&&&Excellent product.  Best way I know of to keep phone, multiple tablets, and computers fully synced.  You can adjust the file size, wifi only, and a number of other features, like automatically uploading pictures.  This is a critical feature if you want drop box files synced to your device for use when no signal is available!
 - May 12, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.0&&&Problem with large files?&&&I usually have no problems with Dropsync Pro, but for the past few days it hasn't been able to download a 587.5 MB file from Dropbox.  The sync history has several entries saying that the download failed and the sync was interrupted.  I've successfully sync'ed a file about half that size in the past.  Other than this, Dropsync Pro has worked flawlessly.  I hope this can be resolved soon.
 - April 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid &&& 2.0&&&Works Perfectly!&&&Found one more reason to love my Motorola Droid; Having an effective Dropbox app that does its job and does it right! If you are a serious Dropbox and Android user, stop reading this comment and get Dropsync now!
 - May 26, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 2.0&&&some folder couldn't sync&&&some folder couldn't sync don't really know why, I will request refund.
 - March 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 2.0&&&I love it!&&&Works flawlessly on my HTC Desire HD. I use it for my downloads folder and my DCIM picture folder. Note: Choose to sync hidden folders too so you can refresh your Gallery display by emptying the .thumbnails folder out from your pc after pulling pictures off your phone.
 - June 13, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 2.0&&&does not work&&&it does no syncing. when it did, there were a lot of conflicts. No help from suppor even after reminders.
 - May 5, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.0&&&Large files&&&I love the app, but it doesn't seem to be able to sync large files.  The description says "Upload files larger than 5 MB".  It doesn't say anything about a file size limit.  If there is one, that should definitely be added to the app description.
 - April 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.0&&&Simply Awesome!&&&Bough it to support the developer. Works great on HTC Rezound. With super fast 4G and unlimited data I don't have to worry about losing data due to a faulty memory card.
 - May 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 2.0&&&Excellent!&&&This is a must-have app for Dropbox users. If only the official Dropbox app was half as polished/useful!
 - June 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 2.0&&&Great app.Great deal&&&Thank you. Does exactly what I need.

April 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 2.0&&&Writer&&&Now  I can work on the server and the transformer. Irene
 - May 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 2.0&&&Loved it instantly&&&Works perfectly, no BS. Adds the functionality dropbox lacks.
 - June 11, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.0&&&Awesome app&&&Needed this application for a customer and bought it for myself also. Missing one thing, widget that I can click and manually sync. Other than that awesome!
 - April 8, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 2.0&&&Meh&&&It's just expensive.
 - May 7, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 2.0&&&Too expensive&&&Only supports dropbox and is severely lacking in features and settings compared to 'FolderSync' which is half the price!! Get FolderSync instead!
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire S &&& 2.0&&&Money well spent&&&Works perfectly. How the official Dropbox app should be.
 - March 27, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.0&&&Good Buy&&&Works just like it should. Two way sync of only the folders you want. A little pricy, but worth it.
 - June 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.0&&&One word review&&&Glorious

 - June 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.0&&&Captivate. What Dropbox for Android should have been.&&&Love instant uploads of pics, attachments, etc. Changes are always on the other machines I use. Makes my Captivate part of my office. Recommended
 - February 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.69&&&Indispensable dropbox addition&&&Incredibly good developer support. This excellent app does everything it says, and does it well. Be aware that file datestamp issues are a failing of dropbox, not this app. Also note that remotely deleting pics/music may leave orphaned index entries for the now missing file in the gallery/music app. This is a bug in android, not this app! Use SDrescan app to fix if necessary. Unchecking 'instant upload' will minimize this, if a nuisance, by giving a chance to locally delete bad pics, just taken, before they get onto other devices, only to be deleted by the app leaving a dead index entry there. This is a first-class app and a must for any dropbox user.
 - March 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.69&&&Perfect&&&Hey Joel Fabiani, don't you know what files you've updated/deleted on desktop/phone? Anyway, you can find that in your history on the dropbox website! I can't find a flaw in this app...
 - February 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 1.69&&&Perfect&&&Why doesn't dropbox just come with this? Great app.
 - March 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.69&&&Automatic Sync, I Love It!&&&Now I have access to ask my files anywhere I go! I love how it can sync to your hot swappable SD card, and automatically upload camera photos.

 - February 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.69&&&It just works&&&
 - February 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.7&&&awesome app&&&App does everything it says it does and does it well.  Initially I was seeing a problem where I was getting the message "autosync not allowed", emailed the developer who responded RIGHT AWAY and suggested it was might be my power condition setting (ie, set not to sync if power was below 80%). Turns out that was the issue.  Very impressed with the app and developer responsiveness
 - December 5, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.7&&&Great app & great developers&&&Dropsync is the epitome of syncing apps.  I had a minor issue with the Pro version's multiple folder syncing, but 2 hours after I emailed the developer, they had it fixed.  At first, I bought the Pro version for multiple folders, but I would buy it again to thank the developers.
 - August 31, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire S &&& 1.7&&&Excellent app. Very useful. I manage my photos, music, pdfs and other data on ...&&&Excellent app. Very useful. I manage my photos, music, pdfs and other data on my computer; the syncing is left upto the app! :D HTC Desire S
 - November 29, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.7&&&If you use Dropbox you NEED Dropsync!&&&This is how the official Dropbox app. should be, lightweight and efficient. I would not use Dropbox if it weren't for Dropsync. What's the point of downloading files if they don't sync back to Dropbox once I edit them?? I don't really need the PRO version but I got the PRO Key just to reward the hard work of the programmer. Oh, and once you go Dropsync, you don't need the official Dropbox app anymore!! :)
 - January 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.7&&&Works as stated! Dev is very responsive!&&&This app is great and keeps my data backed up to my desktop. Dropbox is great but selecting individual files is a pain so this app comes in very handy and syncs regularly. I emailed the developer asking about a one-way sync and I received a response back almost immediately that this option is in the works. A quick response from the developer means a lot and gave me the confidence to purchase the Pro version. Works great in ICS (Galaxy Nexus).
 - October 27, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire S &&& 1.7&&&Superb, works perfect. Full, reliable 2 way sync. Take a picture, within minutes ...&&&Superb, works perfect. Full, reliable 2 way sync. Take a picture, within minutes its on my pc desktop.
 - December 20, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.7&&&Works well&&&Only needed to purchase once to sync my phone and my tablet with my computer. Developer responded quickly with a fix when Dropbox changed their API and broke things. Appears reliable. Pro Key was worth it.
 - January 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.7&&&Worth every penny.&&&Love the auto sync for multiple folders. Works perfectly. Great job!!! Wish I had bought this sooner.
 - January 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.7&&&Great app!&&&Saved me from the Dropbox Xmas update disaster... However, comment below is true: we need a fresh icon ;-)
 - December 19, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Moment &&& 1.7&&&Indispensible&&&There are only a handful of apps that I absolutely must have on my phone and Dropsync is one of them. I use it for syncing passwords with Keepass between my PCs and phone, syncing my Kindle book library to the Android Kindle app and so much more. The time it saves me from not having to manage the hundred+ passwords I need for work and my personal use alone makes this app a lifesaver.   Spring the $4.49 for this app. You won't regret it.
 - December 7, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.7&&&Worth every penny&&&I don't mind paying for apps when they work as well as this. It works exactly as advertised. The interface is clean, it's easy to set up, and it is very stable. I can't say that about any other dropbox sync app I've tried. The Tasker/Locale plugin is just the icing on the cake.
 - September 14, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 1.7&&&Excellent! I used trial version for weeks before deciding if I really wanted Pro. ...&&&Excellent! I used trial version for weeks before deciding if I really wanted Pro. Now that I've upgraded I'm really glad I did!
 - December 8, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.7&&&Overall fantastic... hope for one improvement&&&Great app, especially for my wi-fi only tablet.  Nice to have ability to fully sync to Dropbox like on a PC, especially when you have storage space to do so.  Not really fair to provide a low rating just b/c you think the pro license is too expensive.  It's well worth it for the price of offline access... if you don't agree, just use Dropbox.  One feature it should have is ability to sync all except one or two folders.  I'd like to sync my photo folder with Dropbox for the pictures taken with my phone but then also sync fully my Dropbox account.  The problem now is that I either need to setup about 20 individual sync folders to do this or end up with my photos being duplicated.  (E.g. uploaded to Dropbox because of one setting and downloaded again into my full Dropbox download folder.)  I wish I could setup one sync for photos and one that would automatically sync all remaining folders to a general Dropbox folder.
 - July 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.7&&&Perfect fix for Dropbox&&&This completes the Dropbox solution on your phone. Expensive, but I use Dropbox so much that not syncing to the phone was a problem. No longer. This works great
 - November 1, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.7&&&Great app&&&Suggestions for a future release:  - toggle to sync sub-folders (for each configured sync folders) - I have 2 sync folders on my device and on one of them I don't need sub folders. - sync log to see which files were  removed / added / updated
 - February 16, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.7&&&Good&&&It is more expensive than what a. Market shows but until now has been perfect. :)
 - December 11, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.7&&&AMAZING App!&&&This app ups the effectiveness of Dropbox 500% by allowing you to sync ENTIRE folders (not just individual files).  I sync back ups off my sd card, all of my pictures and lots of other stuff now with one button press. I seriously can't recommend this app enough!
 - February 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.7&&&Dropsync is just what I needed!&&&Awesome! Automatic! Amazing! Accurate!
