 - June 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.4.2&&&Getting better all the time!&&&Love this app and all the improvements its creator has devised. I'm sleeping better than ever!
 - June 16, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X2 &&& 1.4.2&&&Should have been included in main app, but..&&&Should have been included with Sleep As Android, in my opinion (raise the price a tiny bit?). Other than that, it's a nice bit of functionality to tack on and the price isn't too unreasonable. A little difficult to learn.
 - June 11, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Galaxy S Plus &&& 1.4.1&&&Great App&&&Great add-on for Sleep as Android. It would be even greater when the graphs could be edited (e.g. zoom) more simple. Double tap for share is also annoying if you don't want to share anything. Maybe future updates will fix this. Nevertheless it's a great app. Keep up the good work!
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.4.1&&&Fixed!&&&Great response time there dev, latest update fixed the freezing issue.

 - June 8, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3.0&&&Freezing after update&&&After the last update it froze after pressing advice tab. Now hangs on launch. On a galaxy a 2 running aokp
 - June 8, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 1.3.0&&&Annoying Share popup&&&The app seems to improve with each new version, but whenever I drag a graph to zoom or move around, the 'Share' popup appears. When I close it, the screen reloads and I have to zoom in again. It will be incredibly rare that I want to share a graph, so keeping Share in the menu would be preferred.
 - June 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Casio G'zOne Commando &&& 1.3.0&&&Won't open.&&&Just updated and the app won't even open now. Tried reinstalling app still having issues.
 - June 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy 3 &&& 1.2.6&&&This is a great add-on&&&I hope the developer continues to update this section of the app.
 - February 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Droid Charge &&& 1.2.4&&&Excellent addon for an excellent app!&&&It's unbelievable how many people complain about paying less than a cup of coffee for this addon. Clearly they don't understand the amount of effort that is required to develop an application with many features and of such high quality.
 - May 3, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.2.4&&&so far i'm liking it&&&Not quite sure how accurate this app really is, because it obviously monitors your level of sleep depending on your breathing noise. but what confuses me is how does it know what's what. cause I sleep with my husband and we have a fan running all night so how does it know what its really hearing.
 - May 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.2.4&&&Amazing!&&&This is the most comprehensive alarm ever. You won't need anything else, it tracks your sleep to wake you up in an optimal way, it has many captchas so you are sure to wake up and don't just cancel the alarm. The developers are always fast with bugs and comments. If you're not using this, I don't know what you are waiting for!
 - May 7, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.2.4&&&Misnamed - should be called sleep "charts"&&&The "stats" are actually charts showing: * Sleep duration (line graph) actual and average * Sleep debt (line graph) actual and average) * Pattern - which is Wake up/Fall asleep times (bar graph)  * Smart - which is how long before scheduled time did the alarm go off * Rating - average rating (doesn't show actual) which is thrown off if you don't rate (includes non-rated days as zero)  I already know what time I go to bed. I don't need a paid add-on to tell me that. Sleep duration and sleep debt are both already in the main app - all this does is give you charts of it.   What I expected was stats like: * how many and how long on average were my deep sleep periods * how many and how long were my light sleep periods * how do these compare when I go to bed at a reasonable time vs when I am up way too late  THOSE are stats that would be useful. I like the sleep app overall but would rather not have wasted my money on this "add-on".   If I could return this, I would.
 - February 26, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.2.4&&&Using with Galaxy Note&&&Still doesn't sync the ideal sleep time with the main app. Actually when I change the ideal sleeping time it always changes it back to wrong value. Otherwise very good :) Please fix and I'll update my rating!
 - May 27, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.2.4&&&Not bad&&&Sleep debt algorithm needs tweaking - I have an accumulated debt of 7hrs from weeks ago. I'm no sleep researcher, but as far as I can tell, my sleep habits don't hold a grudge that long.
 - May 22, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 1.2.4&&&Regresses functionality&&&I like having lots of details, sadly installing this removes one key figure from the set - it stops the 'Deep sleep %' stat from showing on the initial graph, with it's visual green bar at the bottom. Perhaps this data is shown elsewhere (I couldn't find it), but if so, it's not as clear.
 - April 28, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.2.4&&&Helpful but...&&&Needs add/edit the start/end sleep times to account for unrecorded naps or to repair user error. Stats much less accurate for me without.
 - February 19, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.2.4&&&Don't see the value in paying for this&&&
 - February 9, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Legend &&& 1.2.2&&&Decent&&&Crashes rather often, but a nice app when it works.

 - January 22, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.2.1&&&Misleading advertising.&&&Should be a module within the main sleep as android app - this extra thing to pay for is money-grabbing. I WANT MY MONEY BACK
 - January 23, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.2.1&&&Meh&&&I agree should be merged into main app...I don't think it brings much for the price...maybe worth it to visual people who need to see a graph, but it doesn't bring any new or helpful info that isn't already recorded
 - January 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.2.1&&&Nice&&&Loving the new zoom features.
 - January 17, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Ace &&& 1.2.1&&&Alright&&&It's alright as long to remember to use when you are sleeping
 - January 8, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola Droid 3 &&& 1.1.9&&&Eh&&&I wish the graph would work better for people who work nights and sleep past noon.
 - December 11, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Shooter &&& 1.1.9&&&Uhm,&&&The vertical axis is not zoomable and the graph goes through the roof. Never updates.
 - December 27, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 1.1.9&&&Great.&&&Great addon, very helpful
 - July 25, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 1.1.8&&&Terrific add-on&&&After a couple of months of sleep tracking, the detailed stats really put things into perspective. No idea why another review said the graphs are useless; the graphs are an excellent resource to visualize your sleep pattern over time. Sure, this should be included in the base application, but for a buck or so for Sleep as an Droid, I don't mind spending another buck or so for the detailed stats to help support the devs.

 - June 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Samsung Droid Charge&&&Awesome&&&It's pretty cool to see all these stats together in graphs. It really gives you great insight into how you sleep according to sound and movement, and the dev is actively updating. Super great for the price too!
 - February 19, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Samsung Galaxy S2&&&Helpful, but should be part of main app.&&&Build this into the main app, charge slightly more for the main app but less than 99p more. You can still make more money because you sell significantly more of the main app than this add on.  Bad business sense and makes you look scammy and dishonest.
