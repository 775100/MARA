I've tried contacting dev to figure out what the deal is. Great lwp if you don't want to use custom backgrounds though. Being that's the sole purpose of me purchasing this lwp though I have to down rate it.

 - December 24, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Wildfire &&& 1.98.14&&&Worth buying&&&Very good wallpaper with lots of customization options. Only issue I'm getting is sometimes after using an application, the bottom quarter of the wallpaper goes blank. This can be quickly solved by locking then unlocking though. Not sure if this is an issue with my phone or the wallpaper. (Using HTC Wildfire with CM7)

 - June 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.98.14&&&Min/Max Speed&&&This is the LWP that I use daily. It is great. Only one thing does not work properly and that is the Min/Max speeds. There is only one speed, which is the max speed I set. The Min speed does not work. Maybe can be fixed with an update?  Otherwise, great LWP! Now tells me it's not licensed when I bought this some time ago!
 - May 9, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.98.14&&&It's okay&&&This isn't the original Nexus wallpaper, it's close (maybe not close enough but it's all we've got), the particles aren't rendered quite as well, when you touch the colors don't combine to form white light like the original Nexus. This is as close to the original nexus as I've found.
