 - October 3, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - LGE Bryce &&& 1.1.2&&&Decent App. Tough set up.  Slow & buggy&&&It's a decent app for what it does. Lack of category support impairs using with 'Getting Things Done' method of time management. Synch set up was much more difficult than it should be.   Slow to synch from the app.  No notification what it's doing.  Creates duplicates, even when no other source is changing.  Completed tasks suddenly re-appear.  I wish there were an alternative, but FC only licenses their method to these dweebs.
 - September 2, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.1.2&&&Decent start, but many bugs to fix&&&I've been waiting patiently for an app that allows me to track tasks using the PDTL format. This app does that pretty well. What doesn't work so well: - Task types don't sync across devices or with the cloud, so there is absolutely NO value added by them. - When promoting/demoting a task within a given priority level (e.g., A2 to A4), it doesn't update properly across devices or with the cloud. - Touching the checkbox and updating task status doesn't "stick". Have to edit the task to update the status.
 - August 24, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy Prevail &&& 1.1.2&&&Keeps me busy&&&This app is great. I host several large barbeques and holiday parties every year and this app helps me keep all the tasks organized for each event, The ability to delegate tasks is awesome. It means I don have to do every thing but can still follow up with those people later as I still have the task information. I also like the fact that I can mark a task with a % complete and leave notes instead of just writing it down only to check it off when done.
 - August 30, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 1.1.2&&&Will NOT sync with Outlook unless you BUY PP softw&&&If you can use it STAND ALONE, it works fine. But it will not sync with your Outlook correctly unless you bought Plan Plus. You get a year's service with the FC cloud and that serves as the sync conduit (you have to pay for the service after a year). But if you don't have Plan Plus you CAN'T sync your categories correctly - they go all over the place. Still haven't found the setting to put tasks into A/B/C categories. They should STATE this in the App info as a requirement to sync with Outlook.
 - February 21, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 1.1.2&&&Great features, but too flaky&&&I love the ABC123, drag and drop, as well as the daily and master lists, unfortunately the application just isn't reliable enough yet to use. For example, when switching a task from the master list to the daily list it never moves to the daily list, it stays in the master list. Once they fix all of the bugs I think this will be a great app, by far the closest one so far I have seen to the paper process I like to use.
 - July 24, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Fit &&& 1.1.2&&&Great Productivity tool; absolute peace of mind&&&I had been using Franklin Covey planner for last 12 years. It was great to see it being available for Android now. I downloaded it and using it now. This is simply great. "Sync capability" with outlook ensures that all my devices have latest information all the time. Absolute peace of mind, leaving me focussed on what I should spend my time on it.
 - October 28, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Infuse 4G &&& 1.1.2&&&Highly Dissappointing&&&I have been using PlanPlus for years. I was very excited to find out that they finally developed an app for android. I thought I could finally go back to using my PP Outlook add-In. This app has been nothing but disappointing. I'm having to walk through setup every time I open up the app. This is both time time consuming and inconvenient. Although I still love the Franklin Covey system, at this point I would have to say that this app is a waste of money.
 - October 15, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.1.2&&&Is this the best FC can do???&&&I can't even use it, because I got a new phone and it won't let me log on. It keeps telling me there is someone already with my user name. No kidding?
 - November 1, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.2&&&Great for tasks&&&I was trained on the FC ABC system and after years away from it, I find it's the only way I can organize.  This app fills that need - simply using the ABC system.  I have no need to integrate with my calendar, so if you just want the basic (but effective) ABC123 FC they are known for, this works.
 - December 25, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.1.2&&&Amo6002&&&Does not appear that the developers ever tested the software on other than their own devices.  Way too awkward to use on Galaxy Nexus.  Love Franklin Covey.  Not so much this app.
 - August 16, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.1.2&&&Worthless, save your money till they fix it&&&I have been a FC fan for years, however, once again, their ability to launch anything technological is terrible. First it takes them almost a year to get a product out and then it is worthless. The sync with outlook, their cloud and the app is crap. Nothing matches on the three locations so it is not really syncing. How they can build an app with different fields than their cloud and Plan Plus for Outlook is beyond my comprehension. Save your money.
 - July 28, 2011&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.2&&&So Disappointed!&&&Why push software out before it is ready? I was excited to see PlanPlus, BUT it did not install properly. Force Close Force Close and Force Close. FranklinCovey wants $14.95 to support the installation. Really! Refund and move on.
 - October 8, 2011&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.2&&&Worthless&&&I have been a Franklin Covey User for 25 years and have used the electronic version for almost 20 years.  This is the most worthless piece of junk I have used - not worth the 4.95 I paid.  My Outlook tasks were NEVER in synch with my Andoid.
 - October 1, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.1.2&&&Online entries always override updates with evo (reverses work done). Does not ...&&&Online entries always override updates with evo (reverses work done). Does not sync correctly. good idea, poor execution.
 - January 9, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.1.2&&&Junk.&&&Junk.  Can't rename or rewrite tasks.  Check something as completed and it still shows up. Don't buy.  Pencil and paper is quicker and more reliable.  Also, doesn't show the whole task.  Has a very short character limit.  I wouldn't use it even if they paid me $20/month to use it.  Big waste of time.
 - April 4, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 1.1.2&&&Too Many Force Closes&&&I'm running this on my Xoom tablet on Android, and I was excited when I came across this because I've used Franklin for 20 years in some form or another.  This is not working well: when you try to transfer uncompleted tasks, it force closes EVERY SINGLE TIME! It takes about 6 times to finally get them all cleaned up.  When you update a task status, IT FORCE CLOSES EVERY SINGLE TIME! I've reported this every single time, and no fix.  Hello? McFly?  Fix or I will delete and go to a different task manager-what a shame, so much possibility for being the best, but lack of response.
 - November 24, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 1.1.2&&&Disappointing&&&This app was clearly built without any thought to basic usability. It's the FC system, but the app is so clunky that it's barely better than paper.
 - January 31, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.2&&&unusable for me&&&crashes very often, can't change master task to a daily task without it crashing.  Same problem on samsung galaxy s2 and asus transformer.  had issue with their sync app, registration was flaky although I got that working eventually.  I contacted their support and they couldn't fix the crashes. I really wanted to use this software. I like the Franklin task system. Maybe they will fix it later (i used 1.1.2). I was told by Franklin support I would get a refund but did not.
 - May 12, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.1.2&&&Disappointing&&&This app is buggy, poorly designed, completely user-unfriendly, and uncustomizable. 5 bucks wasted. Unfortunately it's exactly what I've come to expect from Franklin Covey from the last ten years of their software.  Nothing good since the first Desktop. They need to practice what they preach, urgently.
 - July 29, 2011&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.2&&&Terrible -Waste of money&&&There is no clear instruction on where to find the URL required to work. It thinks you have Franklin Covey Planner. First Android market app that I have had any problem with.
 - March 27, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 1.1.2&&&Crashes everytime I open&&&It could be a cool app if it worked.  But it crashes everytime I use it.
 - September 21, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 1.1.2&&&Very buggy&&&This thing is very buggy on my Galaxy Tab 10.1. It FCs all the time and reordering tasks generally does not work. I've found it easier to just login to my PlanPlus Online account over using this software, which is unfortunate because I'm not always near a WiFi connection. What really drives me up the wall is that a lot of my fields from PPO tasks don't seem to sync over to this mobile app. This app needs a lot of work.
 - July 28, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Infuse 4G &&& 1.1.2&&&Does not sync everything in Task List&&&This is a nice product, but I found that it doen not populate every item in yiur Outlook Tasks. I frequently check "Follow Up" in a contact record and Outlook places this event in the Task list for follow up. These events are not synced.
 - June 15, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.2&&&Blank Screen&&&When I entered the information on my Galaxy S2, I just get a blank screen.  It worked fine on my old Epic.
 - August 1, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 1.1.2&&&all FC features- Not well integrated w/ Droid&&&I love that I have my prioritized task list back! But this app does not have the ability to show my tasks along side my Google calendar. Nor does it have a Widget for the Droid phone, which means I have to open it every time I want to see/edit my task list. A well-integrated Droid app has a Widget!!! I was a die-hard FC Planner user but I would like to see this better integrated with what Droid has to offer. I don't need it to integrate with MS apps. I want it integrated with my DROID (ie, Google apps.)
 - November 17, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Dell Streak &&& 1.1.2&&&So far...good!&&&Setup was easy. I LOVE the task list, this exactly what I was looking for.  Still figuring it out.
 - May 31, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.2&&&Terrible&&&WARNING: DO NOT install this app! Nowhere is it told that you need the FC PlanPlus Online version to operate this app. I falsely assumed that having FC PlanPlus for Outlook would be sufficient. I never received notification back from their Customer Service as to if I could work with the app or not. It was only upon further research that I discovered the FC PP Online vs. Outlook version issue. And after submitting my request for a refund, it has almost been 2 weeks with no reply. It's only $4.99 but it's the principle of the NO SERVICE that is most frustrating.  Will wait until new iPhone 5 to rectify. :)
 - January 4, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.1.2&&&Flawed but useful&&&Have you ever seen the Dilbert cartoon about to-do lists? "Put all of your high priorities on one list and your low priorities on another." "Then do everything on both lists even if it kills you. Otherwise you're a freakin' loser." I guess I'm a freakin' loser. I have hundreds of tasks on my list. For today, I have 32, and I'll roll most of them over until tomorrow. As flawed as it is, I've used PlanPlus for Outlook for years, as there's nothing better (at least if you run Win7 64-bit). I use this app to sync my Android phone with my Outlook tasks. The app itself is pretty good, actually, nice design, works pretty well. There are two major flaws, however. 1) I have to manually sync on my PC and then manually sync on my phone. This is two steps too many. 2) The tasks on my PC end up in a different order on my phone. I have no idea why. Maybe it's because I have so many tasks in Outlook (between my Master Task List = no date, and ones for the next few months, there are a couple hundred). But at least they're there. I suspect some sort of a slipstream upgrade will fix this some day.

Click that and it gives a few options to mark the task, "completed" being one of them.
 - December 20, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.1.2&&&JP&&&Absolutely love what this app does for me on my galaxy s.  I grew up using the system of ABC 123.  System keeps me focused on what is important.
 - November 18, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.1.2&&&Not up to Franklin Covey Standards&&&This app is not up to Franklin Covey's high standards.  It does not sync well with the online website, changes are frequently lost on sync.  The website is very hard to use.  It takes multiple steps to enter a task that is due on a different date.
 - February 24, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Droid Charge &&& 1.1.2&&&Useless&&&Suppose to be able to sync with cloud.  Had it now for 6 months still doesn't work.  They say they are working on solution but alas no deal.  Don't waste money on it unless just want to use on phone only.

 - August 12, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Droid II &&& 1.1.2&&&Usable, But Flawed&&&A much needed extension of PlanPlus for Outlook, this app is helpful for me. ABC, 123 drag & drop are great. But Droid app introduces - "Types?" I' already have "Categories" in PP for O, why not import them? So, tasks now have a "Category" for desktop, but a different "Type" for the Droid, which must be reassigned to each. Worse, these "Types" are invisible. Yes, they are there; tasks are sorted when assigned a Type, I just can't see what it it is before it's selected. Skilled guesswork required.

I liked the Franklin Planner Software for Palm, back in the day. Loved it. Miss it. FC has not been able to produce software since. I am talking about 10 years now and counting: they have failed to meet the demands of the electronic smartphone industry. I hope they read this! C'mon FC! Look at the GTD phenomenon, realize that you have a consumer base, but if you don't make a product that works, you will lose it.
 - February 29, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.1.2&&&Doesn't work&&&Do not buy. I bought this months ago. It would not sync. After having deleted all my history support finally got it to sync. It would not move overdue tasks to today or write back correctly to the online database requiring me to go online to repair the database. Tech support insisted it was working  when it wasn't. After months of trying to get help, finally they didn't answer at all. I have lost my history and am back to using the free mobile ap for the online database. A bit slow, but it works.

 - August 4, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.1.1&&&Great To See FC On Android, but UI Is AWFUL!&&&A Franklin Planner user for 15+ years, I was excited about this app. However, the UI in this thing is so cumbersome, it feels like a burden, rather than a tool to make life easier. Creating a task takes WAY too many steps. To mark a task completed, you can't just check it off the list; you have to go into the edit screen for the task itself, which is maddening! Forwarding task doesn't change its date. For a company that specializes in "effectiveness", FC has a lot to learn about effective user experience.
