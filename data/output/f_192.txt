 - April 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.0.6&&&Did what other Apps did not!&&&This app worked perfect on my Verizon Thunderbolt. It is a growing problem in which contact duplication is occuring due to all the different ways they can be transferred and backed up. This app went through very easily and merged all duplicates for once and for all. Well worth the $.99!
 - July 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0.6&&&Saved Me, after Factory Reset: 1700 dups removed!&&&Verizon did a factory reset, to restore 3G service to my Droid 3: I had had 1740 contacts (mainly from my Palm). . Suddenly, I had 3440 contacts... Contact Analyzer 2 merged 7 contacts, and found 10 duplicates. Seeking a better solution, I bought Contacts Merger. I now have 1740 contacts again! THANK YOU!!!
