 - April 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid Pro &&& Vesion 1.0.1&&&perfect coaching assistant&&&this is my first week completing the workout (using the LITE version).  this app is very helpful.  i had to upgrade to the full version so i can move up the difficulty timer.    -i would like to see the next exercise in a bigger font. -the back button on my phone exits the app instead of going up a level in the menus -the font on the buttons are too small to read -an initial countdown would help out as well to give me time to get set up for the goblet squat  thanks for the app :)    ********used full version this morning on intermediate.  app needs the 2 minute countdown at the end of the workout.  15sec rest before dumbbell push row works but then goes to the "workout complete" screen.  haven't tested this on advanced yet.  i had to start the workout over and use goblet squat as my counter for the push row.
 - March 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version Vesion 1.0.1&&&Fantastic App !&&&Does exactly what I wanted it to do, even have a little flash player animation to show you each workout.
 - May 17, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Galaxy S Plus&&&Poor&&&There is no countdown at the start, so you miss a few seconds putting phone down. The next exercise is too small to see. The sounds stopped halfway through and why is there a 15 sec rest at end? Uninstalled tho no refund I see.Better free ones out there
