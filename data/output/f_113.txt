I REALLY recommend you to buy this app if you have a low download limit like I do (50mb) thanks for this app and have a nice day
 - January 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 3.0.15&&&This AWESOME little app ended my nightmare!&&&I have a Motorola Flipside that I'm using on Consumer Cellular. My data plan is limited; I want to have data if I need it, but would rather not use it if I don't need to. Most places I find myself using data on my phone have Wi-Fi.  I tried a few other on/off switches which worked for a bit but then would simply quit functioning.  But then, I found out about APNdroid reading on an android forum trying to solve my problem. It was highly recommended; I was happy to pay for it as it works flawlessly! Best couple of bucks I've spent in a long time!  It's not a widget, but a very simple app. It opens to single screen with an on/off switch. Tap it once for on or off. It is green in the on position; red, in off. Within a few seconds you'll see the 3G icon react- arrows appearing or disappearing.  THE. BEST. 3G. ON/OFF. APP. EVER.

The problem was that I couldn't shut off data without also breaking MMS. This app was exactly what I needed, and works flawlessly on my Samsung Galaxy Gio.

 - December 17, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.1.9&&&Simple & Effective... Works great w/ AT&T GS2!&&&I only bought this as it was recommended by another App that I was using called BatteryFu... otherwise I'm not sure how long it would have taken me to learn about this great App.  They work great together, but APNdroid works on it's own to save SERIOUS battery life.  When I am out in the world, and don't need data I just use the APNdroid widget to limit my phone to calls and MMS...  With BatteryFu I can toggle the data on once every few hours to get my data to sync... then back to just phone calls and MMS.  I know this app hasn't been updated in a year... but everything is working perfectly on my AT&T SGH-i777 (Galaxy S II) and I'm even on a custom ROM (Unnamed v1.3.1)  Only thing I would say to the author, is why the two different versions?  Is it just because this one is GSM and the "mini" works for CDMA?  To be clear to people looking at this version, this DOES include the widget pictured in the "mini" version of this App and it's what I use... :D
 - July 10, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.1.9&&&Great little app.&&&Nothing fancy,no frills,just a great little app that could save you a whole heap of money! If you're on a limited data plan,install this app & place the widget on your homepage,when you get home or wherever you have wifi, tap the widget, it'll turn red telling you that it's disabled the 3G,out & about,tap the widget again to get a green light you're back on 3G....Simple but effective. I can't believe that people could continuously use the free version & not pay for the pro version.Go on pay the man!!

 - July 28, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.1.9&&&APN autorotation&&&Would you mind to add one more feature. Im looking for automatic APN rotation. I would set up time "A" when APN1 will be active and time period "B" when APN1 will be inactive (no data trasfer). Then app will rotate from APN1 to APN2. During period "A" will be new APN2 active and in "B" there will not be any data trafic. Then rotate to next APN, switch data on for "A" time period etc. Would you try to code this, pls ?
