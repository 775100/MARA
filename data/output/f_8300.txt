 - January 26, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Nexus One &&& 1.0.8&&&Works well. Mild upgrade from Gingerbread.&&&I tried the various free versions on the market as well, and this one really does work the best. The corrections work and are accurate - consistently. Gestures need some work, but I'm fairly happy.
 - January 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire &&& 1.0.8&&&Best keyboard for HTC desire&&&I've had no buggy problems. I think this is better than the swift key keyboard. Much easier to type, clearer layout and I like the extra symbols such as ™®©??°| plus a tab key.
 - February 17, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.0.8&&&Good&&&Fast and good auto correction. I got the paid version because I wanted to download themes. Well bad news, non of the themes work, I get a black screen when I choose any theme I downloaded. I have downloaded like all available themes in the market still black screen. Samsung galaxy note
 - June 4, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0.8&&&Good but needs a little work&&&Like others have said the re-correction is a little buggy.  If you tried to correct a word you've already typed the suggestions won't appear most of the time.  also if you've used ICS before there is still a noticeable difference.  This keyboard is the better (If not the best) one(s) I've used since I can't get used to swiftkey (i just can't like it even when I've tried)
 - January 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0.8&&&Nice smart keyboard&&&Great little app. Very quick and responsive. Has speeded up my Android a great deal. Has some great features like gesture swipes to close the keyboard quickly or delete the last word.
 - June 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 1.0.8&&&Works fine!&&&However mic shortcut doesn't appear on the main keyboard. Error prompt: "Voice input is not currently supported for your language", please support English for ICS keyboard. Otherwise a better alternative to the stock keyboard.
 - February 15, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy S2 Skyrocket &&& 1.0.8&&&Worth the $&&&This is the best keyboard I've ever used.  I just went from a qwerty keyboard to touch screen and the auto-correct was killing me. Don't be a cheapskate, donate for this app and you will get some nice extra features!  I love that it supports gestures!
 - February 9, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 1.0.8&&&Very bad&&&This thing makes all of my text input wonky, reducing space. No! Update and I will consider long term relationship.
 - April 14, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC EVO 3D &&& 1.0.8&&&Awesome keyboard... But doesn't work on forums.&&&Doesn't work on forums on my HTC 3D phone. Freezes a lot. I guess only HTC keyboards work with HTC sense. It's a pity though.
 - May 9, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 1.0.8&&&Excellent keyboard&&&I don't normally do reviews unless I feel an app has helped. I have had the HTC One X for a month and the keyboard sucks on it, always pressing . every time, tried Swift Key which is good, but has small space bar too.  I had ICS keyboard free on my S2, so tried it on my One X and I can finally text again with out hitting friggin . all the time! So paid for full keyboard.  Will give 5 stars when UK keyboard gets fixed, I need £ not $
 - January 13, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.0.8&&&Awsome but buggy&&&Great keyboard, awsome reaction time, but very buggy. When brought up often stays blank with no keyboard and begins to lag everything out, forcing me to switch input methods. Bionic
 - April 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.0.8&&&Amazing.&&&Perfect keyboard... I hate swype I dislike the stock keyboard, but this shi right here... this shi... its called deaf
 - March 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.0.8&&&So much better than stock SGS2 keyboard!&&&Well worth buying the paid version. Absolutely shames the stock keyboard on the SGS2. Well done dev!
 - April 24, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.0.8&&&Almost perfect&&&Beats the stock Samsung galaxy s2 keyboard hands down. Very accurate and fast. Looks very clean. Doesn't seem to error correct text boxes on web pages. I'm not sure how I feel about that though.
 - June 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.0.8&&&Brilliant keyboard app&&&Finally, a keyboard that works for me! I like that it doesn't have a stupid microphone or language button getting in the way of my typing. The spelling correction is intuitive and helpful and it wants me to double-click to confirm new word save so I don't accidentally save mistypes. Nice layout and themes, very happy. A+++++ would download again.
 - February 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.0.8&&&Best ICS keyboard out there&&&Best out of the 3 ICS keyboards I've tried. Has big keys that are adjustable.
 - February 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Galaxy S2 Skyrocket &&& 1.0.8&&&Awesome&&&This keyboard is awesome. I wish it had height adjustment for landscape as well. If you guys could do that. It would be perfect. Other then that. The auto correct feature on this keyboard is the best I've experienced yet.
 - May 7, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Incredible S &&& 1.0.8&&&I also purchased this to adjust the keyboard height. It doesn't work & skins ...&&&I also purchased this to adjust the keyboard height. It doesn't work & skins are hit & miss. Kept it on good faith but the dev doesn't reply to emails
 - March 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Droid Charge &&& 1.0.8&&&Awesome&&&Outstanding word correction. I can type away without even looking up at my message until the end. Great job!
 - March 27, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 1.0.8&&&It does what it's supposed to&&&But I can't really tell much of a difference between it and the old keyboard.
 - March 30, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.0.8&&&Worth it&&&Nice keyboard but the themes aren't working in the paid version....that's the only reason I gave it 4 stars.....Droid bionic
 - June 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0.8&&&Good keyboard&&&Best keyboard ever!!!! A must have
 - May 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 1.0.8&&&Works great on HTC one x&&&Very accurate, all the functions of a great keyboard.
 - February 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.0.8&&&Easy to use&&&Very easy to learn the interface and it runs great on my phone. Samsung Epic 4G
 - May 2, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 1.0.8&&&Does the job.&&&Works very well. Had an issue with the popup letters being cut of, showing half the letter, after changing the system font using Font Changer. I just wish there was a way to add a margin to the bottom of the keyboard. On the Atrix, I have issues typing in portrait mode. Otherwise, works well.
 - June 28, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 1.0.8&&&Please add language switcher&&&I love this keyboard and I would give it 5 starts but I'm getting nervous whenever I tried to switch keyborad language. Please add switchercbutton or configure space button to switch the language (long press for example) !!
 - June 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.0.8&&&Thank-you&&&I love this keyboard so much. I had it before I got my new s3. Samsungs default keyboard is terrible I hate the overintusive auto correct. This keyboard is the best on the market get the full version. I find that I don't press keys by accident. Worth the money.
 - June 7, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC One S &&& 1.0.8&&&Bought it for $2 and I cant use it ...what a wast . Can ...&&&Bought it for $2 and I cant use it ...what  a wast .  Can only use the standard keyboard
 - May 10, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0.8&&&Its okay&&&I like it in portrait mode but in landscape its really small and there's no way to adjust this
 - July 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Defy &&& 1.0.8&&&Even better!&&&The free version is good but you get super extra features by donating, gesture to delete last word for example. Well worth supporting!   Punyweakling's skins work well with this - most are free.
 - June 22, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0.8&&&Never updated&&&Keyboard was great on release but has slowly become less and less useful due to the lack of updates.  There are many bugs and simple features that could be added but the developers refuse to do so.
 - June 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.0.8&&&Great keyboard&&&Love the auto correct way better than the Samsung one as it was really annoying and really off but would love to see a Korean support for the keyboard Also the height for keyboard on whatsapp is bugged cannot change the height when using the alphabets
 - June 22, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 1.0.8&&&qwerty&&&I bought this app to get a QWERTY layout for the Czech keyboard, but this app doesn't have it :( I'm disappointed.
 - June 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.0.8&&&What a lifesaver!&&&I'd been using a Galaxy Nexus for a while now and was really loving the new keyboard for ICS.  Then picked up a Galaxy SIII and had a lot of troubles getting the Samsung keyboard to work well and was getting really frustrated with the poor auto correct.  Happened to find this and now my Galaxy SIII is perfect!  If no one told me this wasn't the stock ICS keyboard, I never would have known! Thanks for all the hard work to make this excellent keyboard replacement!
 - June 10, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 1.0.8&&&Great, but have suggestions and GS3 issues maybe&&&Thanks for making this! It has a nicer feel than the stock Samsung keyboard that comes with the new Galaxy S3. It feels easier to use and the options are pretty good. Just a few suggestions though:  - Make the swiping a bit easier to use, maybe having an option to change the intensity of the swipe. Swiping in any direction actually creates more mishaps than working for me. I'd really like to be able to flick in the direction as opposed to having to swipe all the way across the keyboard.  - Have an option to switch the comma button (left of spacebar) to an apostrophe. Apostrophe may be used more than comma so it'll be nice to have a dedicated button for it. We already have comma as long press of period so it feels we have two easy access points to comma.  Problems: It's probably a new problem with this new phone, but the keyboard height doesn't work on the Galaxy S3... at least from what I can see. Oh and I think there may be issues with the voice input... doesn't appear to work, or the microphone button doesn't appear.
 - June 4, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0.8&&&Great layout but buggy.&&&HTC Rezound rooted on ICS. about 30% of the time, the kb does not come up, only a black screen on its place. I normally have to close the app and re-open it in order for it to show up. Also, please make it default to letters rather than numbers when you launch it.
 - March 31, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.0.8&&&Missing voice input.&&&The voice input key isn't showing up on my SGSII running official ICS. Samsung doesn't like to include the default android keyboards, even thought theirs is terrible.
 - February 9, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.0.8&&&Text box&&&Why does only bottom half of keyboard look like should? I have enabled got donated version reset phone nothing??? Any suggs

When it switches from Portrait to Landscape or even if you nudge the phone while typing you get a black screen, and have to press the back key to get back to your app.  Sometimes it will freeze up and you cant see what you are typing in the text box, although when you hit enter in chat for example, the text does get sent.  Kinda annoying.  Please fix.

But then I used it! Great everything: automated correction; relevant suggestions; and to add to its perfect rating for the above, it also looks great and for those who may want something more "out of the box" - it supports themes. Support this developer with the donate version regardless of the feature set differences. 5+ rating.
 - January 11, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.0.7&&&Issue with QWERTZ layout&&&When using QWERTZ keyboard layout (French-Switzerland), I should get the numbers by a long touch on characters 'QWERTZUIOP' but it doesn't work for 'QWZ' (nothing is displayed or a wrong number). It seems to be confused with 'AZERTY' keyboard layout. Except this bug, it works fine.
 - January 6, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.0.7&&&eh.&&&its a good keyboard but when it switches from landscape to portrait mode most times it will just show a blank black screen, at which time you have to press the back key to get back to your text. kinda annoying.

I just think the word "donation" should be removed from the Settings menu under "Language & Keyboards", that's the only negative thing I could find even though its not even a big deal at all.
 - January 2, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.0.6&&&Very good, not perfect.&&&Occasionally doesn't capitalize the first word in a message and have had some issues with the caps button not staying on.

Swype, Samsung Keypad, SwiftKey, you name it.  They are all great (well maybe not so much the Samsung, haven't tried the new one since the 2.3.6 OTA update, but no reason to now) but this is by far the BEST.

 - November 25, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.0.2&&&Very nice&&&Accurate,  fast, and decent updates. I moved from NY favorite swype to this and use it daily. Closest accuracy to iPhone keyboard I gave found.
 - March 31, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Samsung Galaxy S2&&&Really nice keyboard&&&Ah, at last, a keyboard that doesn´t insert the last word typed ... I was getting so fed up with the stock Samsung keyboard and sending messages and emails with words which either looked stupid in context or just simply should not have been there!  I type rather fast and sometimes the keyboard doesn´t quite catch up with me so maybe I am not adjusting settings somewhere?  Are there specific settings for the speed of the keyboard; anyone know?  Otherwise, I´m totally happy for the donation version ....
 - May 10, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Casio G'zOne Commando&&&Kind of blows for me&&&The whole reason I purchased this app was so I can use the voice prompt but could never get it to work with my Casio G zone commando.
