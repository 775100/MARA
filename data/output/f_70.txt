 - February 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Wildfire &&& 5.1&&&Simply The Best.&&&Straight-forward, no nonsense, ease of use and a wide range of icons make it the most versatile icon customization app there is in the Market today.
 - February 3, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 5.1&&&sgs2&&&Would have been 5* as I love this app. Once you understand hiw it works its worth the money...but...why do we have to download another app for more icons? Can you please just update this one. The 'free'  download ones are crap and I do not want to pay extra for other icob packs after paying for this app in the first instance! Please just update this app and I will rate 5.
 - January 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 5.1&&&Awesome!&&&I will never b without this app. It allows me to customize my homescreens the way I want. Love it!!! Tbolt
 - March 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 5.1&&&Download LauncherPro First!&&&These icons and docks are awesome. I wasn't able to use them on my phone until I installed LauncherPro. Now my phone looks great! No lag, no crashing. Great icons. Even if there hasn't been recent updates, this is still a solid set of icons. Highly recommended.
 - June 1, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 5.1&&&Needs bug fixes&&&I've had it on my phones for a while. I love the matching styles & that new apps are regularly added. This is the best app for that. However, it crashes often on my Transformer Prime.
 - March 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 5.1&&&Fantastic&&&Serioisly I have been looking for something like this since I got this phone!  The standard Android icons are painful to look at...so many dissimilar shapea and sizes.  I was constantly changing from one buggy theme to the next.  In love with this app and its simple UI!
 - March 16, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G Slide &&& 5.1&&&For 5$ i expected more. Its a hassle to look for the color you ...&&&For 5$ i expected more. Its a hassle to look for the color you want and the style, then pic the icon you want. It works, but the ui could b better.
 - May 27, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Galaxy S2 Skyrocket &&& 5.1&&&Great but...&&&It's a great idea and set up really well, except it's ultra slow at processing and it's not my phone. Love the idea and good for what it is.. please make browsing quicker it lags superly poopy
 - June 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Mini Pro &&& 5.1&&&Love this&&&Quite expensive, but worth of every cent. Actually I might be ready to pay even more.
 - March 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Sidekick 4G &&& 5.1&&&Perfect&&&Has a massive amount of icons for almost every pular app.  I suggest you make icons for draw something and chaos, those games are getting pretty big
 - March 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Droid Charge &&& 5.1&&&Excellent&&&Really wanted a new phone but after LP and Droidicon I changed my mind
 - April 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus 2X &&& 5.1&&&The best!!!&&&I had un mind the icons I wanted and after so much money wasted I founded. These are so elegant. Just perfect. I recommended to buy it.
 - April 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 5.1&&&Effective&&&Been doing the right thing for two years now. To use on stock launchers download smart shortcuts or something similar.
 - June 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Dell Blaze &&& 5.1&&&Good selection&&&Great app. Icon menu is a little slow to load, but if you hit the sort button and select "my apps" you will save a lot of time. My UI obsession is satisfied.
 - June 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 5.1&&&Great, but...&&&Every time i install it asks me to rate... darker colored interface would be great. More style groups would be fantastic. An option to automatically apply all icons to the same style would be great.
 - June 11, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 5.1&&&Could do with more icons&&&Excellent approach, works perfectly. Only tiny complaint: could have more icons or updates. Otherwise definitely worth downloading
 - February 1, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 5.1&&&Fantastic!&&&This app is a must when it comes to personalising your phone. The choice of designs, shapes, colours, sizes & detail are immense. Superb!
 - April 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 5.1&&&Good&&&Rating to stop this thing from popping up again... And.. also, it's a cool app
 - March 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 5.1&&&Extensive, diverse, & customization without equal.&&&I can, with due diligence, offer my recommendation of 5 stars to any individuals seeking the interface-customization with  seemingly infinite variation.  This icon pack can be altered to thousands of unique apps, in dozens of colors with frequent updates keeping things current.  4.99 is relatively pricey for an app; in perspective, though, it's less than a Taco Bell combo & may well be a major portion of your Android ecosystem forever.  Whereas that Big Beef Supreme will be long  evacuated within hours of the meal.  Great work, developer.
 - June 14, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 5.1&&&Blah&&&The dock selection is nice but all the icons are basically the same. Very repetitive and bland. Plus downloading each icon I need, one by one, as it slowly loads.....takes forever.
 - June 7, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 5.1&&&Super! Wide range of icon styles.&&&I've had this app now on several different phones running different android os. I picked up the new sprint evo4g lte and it still works great. Thanks!
 - June 30, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 5.1&&&This app tanked my phone...&&&For a while, I rated this at 5 stars but when I had a problem, I emailed the dev and sent screenshots as per their instructions, and never got a reply
 - March 10, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 5.1&&&: c )&&&I like this app a lot. It would be even better if you could customize the color..... Meaning how dark or light the icon is. Other than that... Love it
 - June 5, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Incredible 2 &&& 5.1&&&So far do good&&&Hope can figure it out a lil bit faster
 - June 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC One X &&& 5.1&&&Excellent&&&Got my phone looking just the way I like it and can change that look whenever I fancy. Worked well on my Desire and just ported it over to my one x, where it looks even better. Combines nicely with launcher pro.
 - February 15, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 5.1&&&Needs more&&&Please add some stock icon options as well... I.E. sense, blur, ICS... etc.  That'd make it an optimal app!
 - January 28, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 5.1&&&too slow for practical use&&&nice icons but they load painfully slow. 1-2 seconds for each icon to display... and there are hundreds or thousands. Not an issue with my processor it's a quad core tablet could be an ice cream sandwich issue. if fixed, will review feedback
 - May 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 5.1&&&An excellent app&&&Works well with other apps like Folder Organizer
 - March 26, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 5.1&&&Raza Maxx&&&Had this app since droid 1. Now with Raza Maxx  & Go launcher ex itz off the chain!
 - March 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LGE Bryce &&& 5.1&&&Personalization&&&There are So many icons and styles to choose from that I can really personalize my phone the way I want to. Fun! Great job dev =)
 - May 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 5.1&&&Great selection&&&A few of my apps had no icons but it's better than the other apparently I've tried. Just wish you didn't have to do them 1 by 1
 - May 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 5.1&&&Must have&&&Would be nice if you could apply the icon image to the icon in the app drawer. Other than that 10 Stars!
 - June 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S3 &&& 5.1&&&The Best&&&No matter how many times i change my mobile or reformat it,  this application must be one of the first on it.
 - February 27, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 5.1&&&Great!&&&Slow at times but otherwise pretty good!
 - March 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC G2 &&& 5.1&&&Excellent app but for some reason in launcherpro plus I can't change the dock ...&&&Excellent app but for some reason in launcherpro plus I can't change the dock background...its probably just me though, anyone know how?

 - February 8, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 5.1&&&Ok&&&Worth the money just for the dock backgrounds, i think the icon packs need a lot more work.
 - May 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid RAZR &&& 5.1&&&Great selection&&&The only two icons it doesn't have are etrade and google drive. Still gets 5 stars from me!
 - February 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 5.1&&&Love it&&&Saves me time from searching for those frosty icons I love.  Very well organized. Would be a bonus to be able to set a style as and icon theme.
 - May 31, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 5.1&&&saves hours&&&Even though launcher pro is pretty much dead, this program got a new lease on life with nova launcher. If time is money, this is a steal.
