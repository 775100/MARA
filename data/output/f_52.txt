 - March 15, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Slider SL101 &&& 2.6&&&Great! but palm rejection could be better.&&&This is great I have used it in class, works well, except sometimes I start writing and nothing appears, only a few dots. I don't think that it is a problem with my device, because I have an Asus eee pad slider. Fix this one issue if possibe  then I will rate 5*'s and recommend to everyone! Still works very well!
 - April 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.6&&&Super App!&&&@ Johnathan - if you go into the settings of this app, you can fine tune it so that if your palm *does* touch the screen, it will not leave a mark on the notepad :)  ++++++  Excellent App!  Just what I have been looking for, and it it so much better than the generic pad app at comes with my HTC Flyer.  Well worth paying for :D
 - January 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Toshiba AT100 &&& 2.6&&&Great App&&&Great app. However, I'm using a Toshiba Thrive tablet and everyone my palm touches the notepad, it leaves a mark and causes strokes with stylus to be interrupted. Any suggestions? Worth the purchase.
 - March 23, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Flyer &&& 2.6&&&Great app! Needs ocr&&&By far the best note taking application I have found for my HTC flyer. I have tried them all! The only thing that's missing is orc (optical character recognition) to transcribe your handwriting into text. If it had that, this app would be perfect!
 - April 28, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 2.6&&&Very Good&&&Works well on my Xoom... Would like export function and optional OCR would be a great step. Can be a little slow at times and times the lines drawn disappear when the next is drawn. overall very good app
 - February 4, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 2.6&&&Exceptional Application&&&Works very well for handwritten notes, writing formulas, writing psuedocode, and adding in typed text. Have not used images yet. Also, I appreciate exporting notes as PDF. ASUS Transformer Prime with Jot Pro stylus.
 - April 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 2.6&&&Great but steep learning curve&&&Greatest pinch to zoom (because it can zoom to any magnification)  and moving in zoom mode button.  But I did not realize those features until after using it for half an hour. I am still trying to figure out how to use eraser in lasso mode to erase stuff in an area. Other than that it is best for writing detection and calibrating stylus.  Beginner tutorial is needed if app developer wants this app with better rating.
 - May 30, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.6&&&Best Palm Rejection&&&None of the other apps on the market has working hand rejection; this works well. Only thing holding it back is lasso select (ala Papyrus) and being able to move images after placing them.
 - January 17, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 2.6&&&Xoom&&&Love the app on my moto xoom. Sometimes a little tougher to be detailed though even with a stylus, but it's definitely worth buying. Would love to see a letter correction added(I always have trouble making e's).
 - May 2, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF201 &&& 2.6&&&Nice attempt&&&Best on market, target device (Transformer and Prime) are just demonstrably hardware incapable of writing recognition due to touch detection speed and inaccuracy. Palm detect doesn't function since time based detection can't determine anything useful (parts of palm tap screen as writing). Would like to see a dynamic position based palm detect instead. Very nice paging features though and very rapid rendering.
 - February 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 2.6&&&Best for the Galaxy Tab 10.1&&&For the Galaxy Tab 10.1 look no further. With  touchscreentune this app is the best. Tabnotes, Lecturepad and Quill come very close (in that order), but in my opinion this here is the best for the Tab. Also palm detection works great :)
 - February 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.6&&&Great app with simple but effective interface&&&This app along with Quill and Freenote is one of the best note taking apps I have found in the market. This one contains features that have prevented me from using Quill and Freenote actively. Freenote lacks the ability to export notes to PDF files and has a very klunky way of organizing pages.. Quill on the other hand does not provide a way to enter text or import images. I think all three are great apps but this one has the most features that are useful to me.
 - February 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.6&&&Writepad Stylus&&&Pretty nice app.  Use it for homework and it's much simpler and easier to use than other notetaking software.  Also I contacted the author for some help with touchscreen sensitivity and he was extremely helpful and quick to respond. Thank you so much
 - May 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Flyer &&& 2.6&&&HTC FLYER -&&&I was unsure of how well note-taking really would be on the Flyer, after using this app with the digital pen however I am more than impressed.  I can write accurately and VERY small legibly.  I can actually use this for taking lecture notes at uni including diagrams with ease.  At last all my notes stored digitally and I can export to evernote or my dropbox. Many thanks to the author, simplest and best note-taking app for the flyer in my opinion.
 - March 27, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.6&&&<3&&&This app is totally AWESOME!!!! It lets me do what everyone is boasting about on the SNote on my Tab 10.1!!! Great for keeping my ideas together for my designs!!!!
 - February 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.6&&&great app&&&Perfect with touchscreentune on sgt 10.1. Missing "lasso-mode" copy cut paste. Helmut
 - January 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 2.6&&&Best writing app thus far!!!!!!&&&This is the first android writing app that I can actually import my teachers notes too....plus I can import anything from the web :-)  you rock!
 - May 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Lenovo Indigo &&& 2.6&&&My handwriting is totally hack&&&And this recognition engine gets it.  I use the keyboard by default, but for journalling and taking notes while I'm on the phone, this IME gets my usage.
 - April 8, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 2.6&&&Slow&&&Sooooooo slow impossible to write.
 - April 24, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Toshiba AT100 &&& 2.6&&&Palm recognition does not work&&&Does not work on toshiba thrive. Palm rejection is horrible!!!!
 - January 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Acer Picasso &&& 2.6&&&Best on market.&&&By far the best on the market. No complaints. Acer Iconia A500.
 - April 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 2.6&&&Great App!&&&I use this app along with 7notes and Adonit Jot Mini. What an awesome combination! I can hand write notes and have 7 notes translate that to actual text and with Handwrite I can then draw as Well! Nice job!
 - January 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Flyer &&& 2.6&&&Like it better than endnotes&&&More responsive and better stylus support on my htc flyer than the intergrated endnote app.
May 7, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Lenovo Indigo &&& 2.6&&&Good app&&&Good app
 - April 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 2.6&&&Good application&&&
 - January 14, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Flyer &&& 2.5&&&Fantastic&&&This is much more responsive than the native note taking app in my HTC flyer! Great feel and features as well. I have tried other more expensive apps and this one is clearly better. To top it off the dev is quick to respond and very helpful. Give it a shot, you won't regret it.
 - January 15, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 2.5&&&Need more zoom feature&&&It's an awesome app...we dont need to bring paper notes ona meeting.. Still missing the zoom feature, so we can create a tiny notes besides the larger one...i.e. want to create a table..  Second one is missing the insert shapes feature...
 - January 11, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.5&&&Soo fast and good&&&I send him some commends yesterday, he Chang that one day later! Great! Good for HTC and lenovo. Five starts product
 - January 13, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 2.5&&&Great Product for Students&&&I've spent a lot of time looking for an app which will let me replace my countless notebooks and the forest I kill in paper each year, and this is the closest I've come to find the perfect app.  I like the way it handles both typing and writing, and there is a free app by the same developer which lets you export to PDF.  It's not perfect by no means, but it's the best Ive found on the market, and can not recommend it highly enough.
 - January 13, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 2.5&&&Chris&&&Incredible app! The only thing missing is font customizations
 - December 27, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - HTC Flyer &&& 2.4&&&Works well on the HTC Flyer, better than the in built HTC option. Integration ...&&&Works well on the HTC Flyer, better than the in built HTC option. Integration with Evernote could be improved.
 - December 28, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 2.4&&&Awesome&&&Thank you for making this left hand compatible.
 - October 25, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.2&&&Very Nice on Lenovo tablet&&&Got thinkPad because of the stylus integration but found the OEM notepad to be limited. This app is a vast improvement and better in every way that matters. Perfection would be ability to move typing cursor more easily, Cooler notebook icons, OCR. I can wait for those things because this app is really good as  is.
 - December 20, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.2&&&Excellent for the Thinkpad Tablet&&&Can both write and type in notes. Can disable touch screen and just use stylus (solving problems with palm recognition). Can do engineering style notepad paper. This is a great app.
 - October 12, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Lenovo Indigo &&& 2.2&&&this is the one! Best for lenovo Thinkpad tablet!&&&Ever since I got my lenovo thinkpad tablet I've been searching for an app just like this! I've tried all the popular ones, (note everything, dulynoted, antipaper note, etc) but none of them was as good as this app. Some how this app's palm rejection detector works 99% better than all the other apps. Worked so well I never needed to turn on the n-trig only option. It also allows text typing and hand writing on the same page! You can also customize pen color and width. Thank you so much for this app!!!
 - October 10, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Lenovo Indigo &&& 2.2&&&Truly fantastic, especially on Lenovo Thinkpad Tab&&&Writepad Stylus works very well, and the developer is very responsive. If you have a Thinkpad Tablet (with the N-trig active digitizer pen), this is a must-have. If you have a more typical capacitive stylus, it's still quite good.
 - October 23, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Lenovo Indigo &&& 2.2&&&Brilliant App, only needs OCR to be Awesome!&&&The Lenovo Stylus only feature is very cool plus its a very easy to use and stable app. Through in some OCR and this would be the perfect notetaking app.
 - October 10, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Lenovo Indigo &&& 2.2&&&Rocks for the Thinkpad Tablet (n-trig pen)&&&Unlike MyScript (default thinkpad tablet app) you can: Turn off touchscreen and use only n-trig pen (no palm rest issues 100%). You can change paper type (lined, graph, white, etc). Better use of tablet real estate (closer paper margins on top, bottom, and side of screen). Better page flipping. Export whole notebook instead of 1 page per time. Fantastic App! Suggestions: Allow to insert pics from camera pic on the fly (not from gallery) + allow cutting/moving selected writing (like MyScript) + night mode.
 - November 2, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.2&&&Works very well&&&Happy I bought it. Perfect for use with Lenovo Thinpad Tablet. The only thing I would suggest to modify, and I believe an easy fix, would be to move the navigation buttons at the bottom of the page to the top of the page.  I keep creating a new page or moving between pages when I am trying to write. Because I rest my palm on the tablet before my pen touches the screen the buttons are still active (they disappear when the stylus touches the screen). Moving them to top would solve this.
 - October 10, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.2&&&very robust and worth every penny&&&This writepad is an excellent app for writing/typing notes on a tablet. I have been using it for a month or so and haven't  had any issues with it. Handwriting is very smooth and the palm detection feature makes it easy to write by allowing the user to have her hand on the screen just like you would on paper. The usability, stability,  and features have been improving with the frequent updates. I also really like the way the change log is written for this app. It is very clear, detailed, and engaging.
 - October 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Lenovo Indigo &&& 2.2&&&Best apps for Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet&&&Exactly what I am looking for  1) Typing 2) Handwriting 3) PDF exporting  The software work great for the Thinkpad Tablet as it completely isolated the palm from the pen input. Nothing I have seen in the market so far. I am looking forward to feature like a further zoom out (smaller characters) and will be the best a fixed page size so that it can cope with the size of A4 paper when it is exported to PDF file. And it will be wonderful if we get a better looking icon for the notebooks :)
 - December 23, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Slider SL101 &&& 2.2&&&Almost Perfect&&&For a new product (andriod tablets) this is the best you're going to get for about another year or two.  The palm recognition is fantastic.  There is a bit of a lag, but that is device dependant. The only feature that NEEDS to be in the next update is an UNDO Button.  Eventually, transcribing handwriting into text will be worth quite a bit of $ too.
 - November 15, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.2&&&IBM should be ashamed with their oem software&&&Just got my TPT (thinkpadtablet) and the OEM note app is horrible. Can't do anything with it, forced to use 1st grader wide rule paper template. pen color change is a pain, "palm rejection" that doesnt work, etc. In short: an app that is so bad, you would delete it, even after downloading it for free. That is how worthless it is.Writepad allows you to use the N-trig pen as the only input source!!! (meaning you can rest your hand while you write without having random lines appear) change paper, add 4 custom
 - October 29, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Toshiba AT100 &&& 2.2&&&Excellent! Just what I wanted!&&&Superbly easy to use!  I wanted a tool to easily capture ideas as they came to me without a lot of fancy formatting or features.  Anything else forces you to think about their interface rather than your idea.  This program is SO simple to use you can just let the ideas flow.  Gotta see how easy it is to save to some other format, but, so far, I love it!  The pen color selector is brilliant in its simplicity and capturing Web page 'snaps' is intuitive.  Get this!
 - October 31, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Lenovo Indigo &&& 2.2&&&Happily Pleased!&&&Thanks for this great app.  As a user of a Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet, this is an app that takes full advantage of the active stylus feature, which is highly appreciated.  I am a grad student and I no longer use random pieces of paper to take notes, i use this for class and my research work, and even I write my students homework solutions in this. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP.  I wanted to send the author some suggestions that will make this app even stronger but the CONTACT THE AUTHOR button didn't work... :D
 - October 20, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.2&&&best app for stylus writing so far&&&works perfect on xoom. It would be better if I can zoom in/out the notebook.
 - December 6, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.2&&&Best stylus writing, but page flip....&&&I tried so many writing apps, and finaly spent the 1 dollar on this. I am glad I did- it makes the most readable writing of any I tried on my Acer Iconia A500, and it is nearly hasle free to use. WOOHOO! FINALY- I CAN TAKE PRACTICAL NOTES!  My hand kept hitting the notication bar- when that happens, I miss strokes, so I locked the screen orientation and tried the flip feature. Now, no matter which way I turn the tablet, it flips- it is always upside down, and my hand still hits the notification bar. The flip setting doesn't work with the lock off, either.  Irritating- This app lost a star because of that- but once it is fixed, I will definately change my rating to a big shiny 5.   Nice app- I recomend it to anyone who needs to take handwritten notes.
 - October 29, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 2.2&&&Not much cop on Galaxy Tab 8.9&&&Mediocre on the Tab 8.9 I'm afraid. The palm detection issue present on the 10.1 is here too, and there is enough of a lag when using a capacitive stylus to make the resulting handwriting unreadable. My quest for a "replace pen and paper" app continues.
 - December 7, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.2&&&Simple but powerful&&&This app is a little light on features, but who cares since it works flawlessly with my Lenovo tablet.  Never slow to load, picks up the pen quickly and accurately, only app that allows pen only input, works great for inking up pictures, file output (PDF or multiple .png files in a .zip) is small and can be easily sent off to dropbox.   Amazing...  Was about to snap my tablet in half after attempting to use several other apps.
 - December 18, 2011&&&2.0 &&& - Toshiba AT100 &&& 2.2&&&Looks good, I like the simplicity...but&&&Palm rec doesn't work on thrive, should of read a few more reviews and saved myself the disapointment.  If it gets fixed I'd probably use it.   It's only a buck at least.
 - October 31, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Lenovo Indigo &&& 2.2&&&Good for Thinkpad&&&Still the best software for writing notes with the thinkpad. However development is slow right now and other software is catching up. Really really needs a feature to insert a page(crucial when writing a lot!) and ability to sort notebooks by date etc.add this and software will be a lot more attractive to business users like me. Good job still!
 - October 22, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 2.2&&&Very good for note taking&&&Palm rejection sometimes makes writing harder especially on the bottom part of the page. Use good stylus like Adonit Jot or sth similar.
 - October 15, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 2.2&&&Fantastic App -&&&This is a fantastic handwriting app, the ability to rest the palm is it's greatest strength. Look forward to user selectable zoom levels to omit the guess work, ideally the way you can write on the new supernote app on the Asus transformer would be the best option. Generally, very happy with app.
 - December 18, 2011&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.2&&&Not very good&&&Is not able to recodnize handwriting. Works only like a painting tool. Notes Mobile is a better app.
 - December 5, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 2.2&&&Not bad&&&Pretty responsive, but when placing palm on, the writing starts to lag behind. Also its been awhile since an update, I'm update please!
 - November 14, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 2.2&&&Not happy&&&As soon as the 15 min was up it stopped working. And trying to contact the developer is impossible.
 - October 10, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 2.2&&&Great App&&&I have tried all of them. Write Pad is out front based upon features, function and Dev response to problems and requests. I use this daily on my Transformer.
 - October 13, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.2&&&not working with Toshiba Thrive&&&I can put down my palm, but then the stylus won't pick up.  It will pick up some, but not all that I write. My palm is not making any marks Still giving 5 stars because Honeycomb apps are awesome, but warning Thrive users
 - November 17, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 2.2&&&Awesome!&&&Writing, illustrations, export to PDF, priceles
 - October 29, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 2.2&&&Great&&&Love it
 - November 20, 2011&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.2&&&Needs work&&&Using the Lenovo Thinkpad Pros: Easier and cleaner interface and tool selection, nice to have variability in the paper options.  I also really like the fact that you can type in notes if you want to.  Cons: Need more options, (i.e. varying the rule, import for documents and powerpoints, for marking them up)  Most important point:  It does not recognize the stylus as well as the native app.  It glitches so often that I spend more time fixing the notes than actually taking them
November 21, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 2.2&&&Fantastic although a few new features would be nice.&&&Very responsive and very useful for doing lecture notes with. Would like to see a feature where you can draw shapes
 - November 29, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - Toshiba AT100 &&& 2.2&&&No Palm Recognition&&&Just tried it out and it would only recognize my palm and not my stylus at all.  Stylus works fine with everything else on the tablet.
 - December 1, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 2.2&&&Love it.&&&This is the closest our have found to penultimate on iPad. Wrist protection is awesome!
 - September 26, 2011&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.1.1&&&Don't bother if you are using Galaxy tab 10.1&&&I was really exited about this app but ended up really disappointed. I'm using Samsung conductive stylus and Galaxy tab 10.1 and its really really bad.
 - October 2, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Toshiba AT100 &&& 2.1.1&&&Love, Love, Love&&&This app offers some features others don't. I can import photos or images and mark them up. I can save as a pdf or send to printer right from the app. Pretty neat
 - September 30, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 2.1.1&&&Great App - Pitty about the Samsung Tablet&&&One of the best stylus writing apps for android - definately the only one so far I have found with palm detection/rejection. Just hope Samsung will fix their firmware for their 10.1 tab to make its touchscreen responsive enough for this type of application.
 - September 22, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 2.1&&&Simply Brilliant&&&Major improvements within days. Typed text now exports. Easy sharing after exporting to PDF. Simply the best Handwriting app I've ever used. Very happy with my purchase. Keep the updates and new features coming!
 - September 17, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.3&&&This is getting to a perfect handwriting note app&&&Improve a lot! It now supports left-handed. The zoom feature makes writing easier. However, I think it would be better if you provided more zoom steps, perhaps 150% 200 % 250% 300%, for the user to choose since I found from "TabNote" that there is a zoom step that I could write better and more precisely. I don't know if this relates to the writing precision technically but the point is it's still a little bit harder than "TabNote" to write. The response speed is almost excellent. Need a little faster!
 - September 12, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.3&&&Almost there&&&Everything is looking good, really would like the ability to copy note book pages and import text document as the page backgroup to take note on top of and im having issues with strokes disappearing randomly
 - September 5, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.3&&&Simple but good&&&Pro: Good palm rejection. Squared & lined paper. PDF export. Con: Response is on the slow side. Sometimes deletes last input, seemingly at random. It would benefit from things like being able to type and insert images. Having to hold down the zoom button to pinch and drag is annoying, I wish it could be a toggle button instead. (Asus Transformer, HC 3.2.)
 - September 15, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.3&&&Simply amazing&&&This app is elegantly simple to use; I use it every day to take notes in class.
 - September 13, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 1.3&&&$1 well spent&&&This is amazing. I'm going to use it for all my classes on my xoom. Works perfect. I cannot thank the developer enough.
 - September 6, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 1.3&&&Just what I've been looking for!&&&At last! a half-decent notepad for a tablet, so I don't have to carry a notepad and pen with me as well! Palm-block seems to work well on my Xoom. Excellent to see it works for us left-handers too. Look forward to putting this to a proper test, but has impressed me in 1st 20 minutes. well worth the small cost!!!
 - August 30, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.2.2&&&Going in the right direction&&&As far as the writing experience is concerned, this seems to be the best app in the market. The inertia of the pen and the auto-smoothing of lines feels just right, and tuning the position of the pen can really yield good results. So far the set of features is very basic, but I am sure that by implementing 3 or 4 more things the author can come up with a lean, simple, intuitive and effective app dedicated to note taking.
 - September 3, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.2.2&&&Needs work&&&The input is quite laggy and the palm detection still needs a lot of polishing. If the author is willing to put in the work, there are definitely ways to fix this. One that comes to mind is to just render the raw drawing when writing and smooth out what's been written after, either as a lower priority process or when the user isn't drawing. For palm detection, it should remember the general area where the palm was and not register anything next time that specific area is activated.
 - August 28, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 1.2.2&&&Excellent&&&Simple and excellent app for taking handwritten notes. Works well with Evernote. Its what I've been looking for. If you're looking to take handwritten notes that can be easily organized and shared, get this app. The status/notification area needs to be locked when the program is running (or an option to do so). An always on feature, with the screen dimming but not shutting off, would also be nice.
 - September 3, 2011&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 1.2.2&&&Good and bad&&&Excellent readability and the output looks very nice provided that you write slow enough for it to register properly. Don't think you'll be able to write full speed. Not the apps fault but the hardware. The palm detection was very disappointing for me on Xoom. Basically did not work. Tried setting the value to higher but no luck. I'd also like to have the option to have wider pages. I keep my xoom landscape 99% of the time and I don't see why I shouldn't be able to utilize the whole screen in that mode.
 - August 31, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.2.2&&&Great note taking app for tablets&&&I have just started to use this app and it is great
 - September 1, 2011&&&1.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 1.2.2&&&Does not work&&&I installed it in my Xoom. The palm rejection part does not work. Difficult to write with a normal stylus.
 - August 27, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.2&&&Phenomenal!&&&I love you. that is all. Trust me people this is a MUST have app.
 - August 27, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.2&&&The best handwriting app on the Market&&&Ever since Honeycomb tablets came out, I've been trying to find a good app for notetaking (with a stylus), and this one does almost everything I need. Not only is it the only app with decent palm rejection so you don't accidentally scribble everwhere, it even has an 'offset' feature, so that you can actually see what you're writing. This overcomes the inherent weakness of using a capacitive stylus, which is that they're all relatively thick. The dev is also very active and listens to the users. Brilliant.
 - August 25, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1&&&Perfect for taking notes in college&&&Looked everywhere for an app to use a stylus to take notes in class with. This is exactly what I was looking for. You can create separate notebooks for each class and easily navigate the pages of the notebooks
 - August 20, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.0.1&&&Good start!&&&A great new app for making hand notes on honeycomb tablets! Still missing some features but I assume those will come :-)
 - January 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - HTC Flyer&&&The best hand writing note for HTC flyer.&&&This app is what I waiting for. Very thoughtful design. Thanks for the developer. It beat the default evernote app in terms of palm rejection and insert page function
 - May 19, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&&&&&Meh.&&&Not very smooth. Erases only after page refresh.
