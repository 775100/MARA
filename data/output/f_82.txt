 - January 23, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Motorola XOOM &&& 1.04&&&Light on features&&&Good resource for the price, but definitely lacks features.  You can't even just browse through the words, you have to begin a search.  Finding words that you don't know how to spell exactly can be really difficult.  It would be nice to browse words by category or letters.  Also linking to other words within a definition does not work.  Xoom ICS.
 - March 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.04&&&Excellent as compare to price&&&This is a wonderful application. It has favourite , conugaison, historic record etc. I did not see any crash complaint on my samsung infuse. Well, its a good tool to start with at any level.

 - January 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.04&&&Not petfect but great&&&Only thing I disliked is flipping back to search window. You can do this without intention easily  while scrolling, and if that happens in middle of searching many words by tapping, the tapped words' stack (history) will all be cleared and you cannot go back to the previous state. Should let us use the device's physical search button instead.

 - July 4, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC Sensation 4G &&& 1.04&&&Works poorly on HTC Sensation/ICS&&&Like many other reviewers, I'm finding stability problems. Works fine for looking up words, and dictionary itself is good (hence 2 stars). But doing anything else crashes the app completely, so can't listen to pronunciations of words, can't click any related links or any of the hyperlinked words in the definition. If you are on ICS and/or have an HTC Sensation, beware. Also 400 mb download, so missed the refund window (bad policy, Google!)
