 - May 7, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 1.2.9&&&Super Mega Awesomeness!&&&Not sure what Kailash's problem is but I bet if he emailed the dev it would get fixed fast. Works beautifully for me,  I have a hard time putting it down. Everything is laid out right In front of you so you can see what's going on as easily as looking at the time.
 - May 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.2.9&&&Great app&&&Better gadget for galaxy note will make the app even better.... Five stars for usefullness.
 - June 28, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.2.9&&&been waiting for such a clock&&&Aesthetically beautiful. Works nice - useful and maybe can be improved adding some settings like choosing which celestial bodies to show or not - or maybe tropical / sidereal toggle or something. Still great - bought it ! Would love the clock (only) not the surrounding background and the related location/ time date info to be running like a live wallpaper that fits the screen - or maybe a bigger widget that fits the screen. The info probably could be squeezed around the dial, so its still there but the clock itself becomes bigger- sort of zoomed in.
 - May 19, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Note &&& 1.2.9&&&Nice&&&Great, love it. 4 stars because I need larger widget for my galaxy note. Will check back.
 - June 16, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.2.9&&&Ok, but I wish the size of the clock fit the space&&&One thing I really did not like was that the clock doesn't take up the full space you give it, edge to edge wise.  I think the clock should be stretched to the edges of the widget space being used.    I really wish it would just scale up or down depending on how you drag/stretch the window, but I would really just like the app to fit the 4x4, 3x3 or 2x2 edge to edge.
 - May 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Sony Tablet S &&& 1.2.9&&&Beautiful app.&&&A good alternative to the standard clock widget. Looks great on a tablet.
 - May 22, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X2 &&& 1.2.9&&&Love it!&&&Good looking app! Function too. What more can you ask for? C'mon!
 - May 1, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 1.2.8&&&Not bad and gorgeous, but...&&&Have had a few force closes... like four in five minutes. Aside from having this fixed I would like more options like settings that would allow for removing modern planets and the ability to display sidereal positions instead of tropical... that would help with finding actual positions in the sky of planets in question.  note: this would be as simple as tilting each theme graphic a few degrees clockwise and adding them as separate sidereal versions of each theme.
 - March 25, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 1.2.8&&&I love it!&&&It looks awesome on my desktop and is a sweet way to keep track of where the planets are and all kinds of other info.
 - March 29, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.2.8&&&Awesome app is awesome!&&&Been looking for one of these for years since i lost my old laptop. Easy to use, awesome skins. I wish it could be my watch.
 - May 6, 2012&&&3.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.2.8&&&Galaxy next&&&Too much forced close and i don't display the app very well. But it's very useful!
 - April 25, 2012&&&1.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.2.8&&&Kartikeya&&&Only dark screen...nothing appear on display.. Bad application..no one should download this..!
 - March 23, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 1.2.7&&&Awesome app&&&Enough said.
 - March 17, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X2 &&& 1.2.5&&&Quick response from dev.&&&Dev responded quickly on some issues.  They have been very helpful and I hope to see some of the minor problems fixed in the future.  Will report back when fixed.  Increased from 3 to 4 stars due to lightning response from dev.  Thank you!
 - March 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Thunderbolt &&& 1.2.1&&&Beautiful and brilliant!&&&This app is awesome, love that it has a widget as well as the full app. The time lapse feature is the coolest thing ever! The handiest pocket astrology tool I have seen, and beautiful to look at too! I wish there were a real one I could hang on my wall.
 - March 3, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.1.3&&&Totally awesome!!&&&This is a beautiful app and so totally what i was looking for.  Planetary positions at a glance. From an astrological perspective the only thing missing is the retrogrades.  Very important detail for astrologers.  More skins might be nice but not as important.  4 1/2 stars technically but wasn't given that option.  Buy it!!!
 - February 20, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.3&&&Perfection!&&&Amazing. Exactly what I was looking for. Exceptional detail.
 - February 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.1.0&&&Updated. Great clock.&&&Great clock. If you get force close turn on gps.
