 - November 30, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 2.0&&&Very Nice Update!&&&The interface is much nicer and catalog is much organized after the updated! But the content still need improvement. It will worth at least 6 stars if the contents are complete. Overall Very Good! One suggestion: It would be nice if some advanced topic or theorem  (ex. differential equations and probability) can have a direct link to Wikipedia, since some of them are no good enough for understanding.
 - February 10, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 2.0&&&Good But...&&&This is a very nice math reference, but I have to remove a star due to the chaotic font changes from one section to the next.  It almost gives me a headache to look at it.  The author should have chosen a default small font and given the user the ability to specify a different size.  The size should be the same throughout.
March 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 2.0&&&Brilliant&&&The app' is fantastic, worth a lot more than what it's asking for! Has helped me a lot with my differential equations :-)
 - April 20, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 2.0&&&Wonderful app&&&Only improvements i could make are the use of a consistent font size, more content in some areas, links to articles on the web that could explain the details of each section in more detail and the inclusion of a calculator, polynomial solver in the tools section that would make this the perfect app for anyone who has an interest in or has to use math often.
