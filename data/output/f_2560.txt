 - June 16, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.29&&&Extra useful so I bought it&&&Thanks dev, just bought the donate version keep it up! One of the most useful app as I don't hear my messages from the first time
 - May 19, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Ace &&& 0.29&&&Superb&&&Works flawlessly with my Galaxy Ace Plus, now i never miss my messages and emails. Spot on thank you.

 - May 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.28&&&Haven't missed a txt message yet!!&&&This does one thing very well, it lets you know you missed a message. Something so simple yet it had to have a 3rd party app written to do it. I miss so many message from my wife or missed phone calls for work. Not anymore. Thank you for writing this app. Well worth the paid version to get the sleep timer for night time.
 - April 12, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 0.28&&&Brilliant on HTC Desire HD&&&Its always been difficult to find a phone that flashes the screen for me.  This program does exactly that.  I am extremely deaf and never hear the phone go off - voice calls are immediately cut off but I missed a lot of SMS messages.  Not any more.  Once I have worked out the timing on the system it will be good but has already paid for itself.  I have received several SMS and because of the screen flasing, never missed one.  I am so pleased I found this and the cost is pretty good too.  Its a shame its only 5 stars - I would have liked to give it 10!!!
 - February 6, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 0.28&&&Suggestions&&&No easy way for feedback. Need more options for interval checks. Should specify time offset from the hour for those with two phones to have staggered checks and save battery. ie 5:00 pm + 5, and + 10, both check every 15 min
 - March 6, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Ace &&& 0.28&&&Not sure.&&&Not sure but its either this app or my call anouncer or both that keeps changing my fone volume. Im still gona use it though.
 - April 8, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 0.28&&&Very cool&&&Works great with my sprint Samsung epic 4g 1st Gen
 - April 6, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 0.28&&&Great!&&&Was looking for one that works! Thanks!
 - November 27, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G &&& 0.27&&&Very useful!&&&Great app for the deaf and hearing impaired too! Also helps knowing if you have a text/notification when you leave the phone sitting across the room!
 - December 28, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 0.27&&&Brilliant&&&Took a while to set up, I did not realise at first, when testing, that it only works when screen is in stand by. All works just fine now never miss anything anymore, will also notifiy you of any app notification as well, great app well worth the small fee. Galaxy S2
 - January 10, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.27&&&Finally, one that WORKS!&&&I've been trying every notification-bar-reminder-app. in the market and most have bugs and/or other bothering issues - so far this one works flawlessly. Highly recommended!
 - November 20, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Wildfire &&& 0.27&&&Tiny and effective&&&Gets me out of the house on time. Love the new feature of working with any app. Now it insists on me doing my tasks. HTC Wildfire.
 - January 17, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.27&&&Works Well&&&Works great and reminds you of missed notifications.  It would be nice to see a way to select which Gmail inboxes to notify on... I have 1 personal and 2 work gmail accounts.   I would rather just be alerted to missed work emails throughout the day.  Other than that... great app.
 - December 14, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.27&&&Not bad, but some rough spots&&&This app does what is says is does for the most part. For missed email it would be nice if you could select which email account in your gmail or K-9 apps that you would like to be notified for.  Also, I noticed the on the Droid X2 MMF does not seem to work for the native mail app. I monitor separate personal and work email accounts that use the same email app. I like the Sleep Schedule option and the multiple different ways that you can be reminded (eg. flashing screen, vibrate on intervals, and good ol' audible alarms). Keep up the good work.
 - December 6, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.27&&&Excellent app&&&I use this for text messages only. Works exceptionally well.

 - February 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 0.27&&&Finally!&&&Someone clever got it right! :) Hard to believe Android is at v4 and still can't repeat alerts like my old pager already could back in 1996... Thank you!
 - July 14, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy Prevail &&& 0.26&&&Works great with Samsung Galaxy Prevail&&&Does it exactly what it says and does it well. I was really annoyed that the Prevail doesn't have any kind of LED to indicate when you have missed a call or message, and this app fixed that. I had to mess with it a little to get it working, but it works great now. I think I fixed it by changing the screen flash method to Alternate 1. Thanks for this great app! I love that you can choose what type of notifications cause it to flash. No need to be constantly bugged by facebook updates or other minutiae.
 - October 20, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 0.26&&&The App that I've been searching for!!!!!&&&Love it. Would suggest more granular controls. Specify alert tones per email account. The option to exclude accounts.
 - July 17, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 0.26&&&Works great but odd timings sometimes&&&I use the sound alerts since I miss screen flashes as well as calls! And it works very well indeed, except that even though I've lengthened the times between beeps it doesn't seem to pay much attention to that for the first two reminders. But it's a small irritiation. Now if only it worked with ProSMS, I'd be really happy!
 - November 1, 2011&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.26&&&Does the job but can use at least one upgrade...&&&Been using this app for a few months now and relatively happy with it.  Very useful and reliable! But, I would really like to see an option where I can set the notification to not come on WHILE I AM ON A CALL.  Nothing more annoying than being on a call while the phone is vibrating and "ringing", because someone called me/left a message while I am on the call.

 - October 9, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 0.25&&&works great samsung galaxy s2&&&Very useful app! Five stars for separate gmail accounts and specifying of alerting of SMS from specific number.
 - September 20, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.23&&&Just the app for the job&&&I had a problem with not receiving alerts for whatsapp messages when on silent with my Samsung Galaxy S2 and this solves the problem perfectly. Works well and recommended. Also supports many other apps.
 - July 24, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 0.22&&&Great app but...&&&Hi, fantastic job with this app! TIP for all of you: You can even change the vibrating intensity in this app by using the Haptick Feedback in SETTINGS-SOUNDS of your phone (at least for the Samsung GS2). Once the Haptick Feedback is enabled, you can change the vibrating intensity just below, it will also change the intensity in the app.
