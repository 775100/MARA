 - May 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S &&& 1.2.6&&&Great DOSBox port&&&Very fast: makes use of M-HT's dynrec ARM backend update from the official DOSBox forum (the same patch is used in DOSBox Turbo), and this really kicks ass: Doom and Warcraft 2: 20000 cycles (13000 before) with flawless sound playback; Worms+, Ultima 7, Heretic run with 13000 cycles instead of 9000 now (Galaxy S @1.3 GHz, Darky's ROM 10.4.2, Semaphore kernel 2.5.0). AnDOSBox has been around for a long time and therefore is very mature. Everything's smooth and polished, and it features the best mouse emulation of all available ports.

 - March 28, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.2.5&&&Excellent&&&Best port of Dosbox I've been able to find for Android. It keeps on getting better and better!
 - March 29, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - HTC myTouch 4G &&& 1.2.5&&&Unusable without paying extra&&&Buyer beware. In order to get the virtual Dpad shown in the photos, you will have to pay an extra $2.50 for their gamekeyboard app, which makes this app practically useless unless you fork out extra money, as most dos games require the arrow keys. I cancelled my order and went with dosbox turbo which has a free gamepad addon.
 - March 30, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.2.5&&&Great Emulator, Awesome Developer Support&&&I had an issue with the game Master of Magic running slow on my 7inch tablet (OMAP-4430 w/ 1GB RAM), and email the developer about the issue. I got a response within 3 hour of my email. After 3 or 4 correspondences back and forth within the same day, the developer was able to help me resolve the speed issue, and now MoM run at near full speed (game runs at 100% speed most of time, with minor slow down to ~75% normal speed once a while).  For those of you that is also playing MoM on anDosBox, that runs a little bit slow also. Go into the dosbox.conf file in your sdcard root directory, and un-comment out the cpu cycle setting line, and change the 4000 value to 10000. Save the file, and launch anDosBox. It should run at almost perfect speed now.
 - April 6, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.2.5&&&Have to pay Extra for Cursor Keys&&&If you want the virtual cursor keys shown in the photos, you have to pay $2.50 extra!! Very deceptive advertising, as practically all dos games need some type of cursor keys.  I should have read the comments before buying.  I tried the flit keyboard, and its unusable for gaming.

CONS: New fast core is unstable for me, but it could be my Tegra2 cpu is not compatible, and there are just way too many fake reviews here! On the more than dozen games I've tried, it runs at the same speed as dosbox turbo.  More than the emulator itself, which is descent, the biggest con is the tooth-pulling it took to get the source from the Author for this GPL program, after over a week of delay tactics/excuses, he did finally de
 - March 26, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 1.2.4&&&The best emulator still! Knocks out the contenders&&&Two great games that really will put my phone through it paces is Fallout and Ultima VIII. So, its only natural to compare the two best DOS emulators and see how they handle these games. If they can handle them well then they should handle anything you throw their way. Well, then we have ourselves a clear winner and it is anDOSbox. DosBox Turbo really fails to live up to the elder software. While neither emulator gives great sound in Fallout, anDosBox does however run the game at playable speed. And, when I say playable I mean all that they need to do is work on the sound emulation and Fallout is 100% playable. As it stands for DosBox Turbo at the moment they really need to work on speed. Whereas anDosBox can render a screen in mere seconds it can takes 10's of seconds load the same screen, and character movement is even more vastly noticeable between the two. My recommendation is anDosBox for now. The developer is just as active and supportive of his software, he just also happens to be the better developer and that is truly what the end user wants. DOS games at 100% speed and sound. This same review will be posted for both DOSbox emulators.
 - March 21, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Photon 4G &&& 1.2.4&&&Easily the best x86 emulation available for android.&&&Totally worth buying.

 - January 31, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.1.9&&&Best dosbox version around&&&Asus Transformer Prime here. Of the various abandoned and active dosbox port projects on the market, this is the most up to date and compatible. The team seems to do a decent job to provide updates.  Wishlist item for 5 stars: Support for a two button mouse (e.g. transformer prime trackpad/external usb mouse) in pen mode. That would make all kinds of games instantly more playable.
 - February 16, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - EeePad Transformer TF101 &&& 1.1.9&&&Superb, but...&&&Love this on Asus Transformer TF101, the separate game keyboard is great and now I can play all the games quite comfortably. The mouse emulation is atrocious though. Getting the cursor to work like trackpad would be much appreciated as now if I want to move the cursor in-game I need to double tap on my trackpad to get the touchmode on only after which I'm able to move the cursor in-dosbox. Also double-clicking is just impossible. I'm hitting the screen frantically, but it seems only 1/20 attempts goes through. Using mouse controls similar to trackpad controls should do the trick. Also mouse support would be neat for tablets that support them. Fix this and 5 stars are all yours.
 - February 21, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 1.1.9&&&Best Dosbox version..&&&But... for charging for a normally open source program, and at 4 dollars, you could try a bit harder to add features that are more Android/Phone specific that don't require you to edit config settings outside of the app.  Shameful really.

I didn't have any luck and they immediately offered a refund (I didn't even ask).  I declined.  Less than 30 days later, I get another email with a fixed version that now works.  This is the level of support that I wish I had for software at 10x the price.

The mouse+keyboard are easy to handle on a touch screen and makes all adventure games (like sierra's) easily playable. One suggestion: Many games rely on the directional keys (arrows) and I could not figure a way to access those keys on the keyboard (there are not in both the 3x4 and qwerty keypad). Am I missing something? Keep up the good work !

This alone made the purchase of my Galaxy Nexus worth the price!
