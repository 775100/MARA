March 2, 2012&&&3.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 2.5&&&it's allright...&&&when you are done it works just fine. but the building your timetable-process is unnecesserarily sophisticated. additionally if you download the light-version first and buy pro you'll have to do it all over again. and also the widget often shows the wrong time.
 - February 22, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - LG Optimus One &&& 2.5&&&Good one, but with minor bugs&&&Very good app. Works as it's  supposed to work. There are two problems-one the auto mute function turns the  sound on even during 5 minutes break-this can lead to some problems when phone rings and you stay overtime. Second-holidays manager is just for show. I set up  duration of my christmas break and it still auto-mutes my phone. What is the point? I also cannot restore previous back up which is very annoying... It is still the best app of its kind

 - February 6, 2012&&&2.0 &&& - Samsung Nexus S &&& 2.4&&&Schedule Delux Plus - Disappointing&&&I purchased this app as I was prompted to by the School Timetable Delux.  I was misled in thinking that the timetable that I spent so much time entering would sync to this app. I was clearly mistaken.  It seems a great app, but the issues I have with it are these:   You can not sync the app to other devices or notebooks.  It would be great if you could import and export data.    This app will not allow you to sync your timetable from School Timetable Delux.
 - August 8, 2011&&&4.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy S2 &&& 1.6&&&Funktioniert Gut&&&Sehr gute App, die alles wichtige kann. Das Design ist allerdings nicht so schön und kommt bei weitem an die App Classes aus dem Appstore ran.
