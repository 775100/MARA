 - January 3, 2012&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.13&&&Best audiobook app ever!!&&&I've been using this app for more than a year now, and although I've tried others as well, i ALWAYS return to this one. Yes, this is a very specialized player, with a ton of advanced functions, and so you need to spend a few minutes understanding what this app can do for you. However, it quickly pays off, and like I said, in my personal opinion there is no better player around.
 - January 18, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Droid Incredible &&& 2.13&&&My favorite for trips!&&&This is a great app. I love to listen to books while exercising, working in the yard, or traveling. I've caught up on some classics that I had never read. Easy to use and performs as expected.
 - December 27, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.13&&&Still in Love!&&&Awesome! I have tried many Audiobook players and this is simply the best there is! Download and enjoy! Update: works great on my Galaxy Nexus (ICS) too!
 - January 9, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Samsung Galaxy Nexus &&& 2.13&&&Excellent&&&Love this player. Had Audiobooks app, didn't work with ICS. I believe this was not a bad deal. So far so good. Galaxy Nexus
 - November 26, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 2.13&&&Ambling BookPlayer Pro&&&Love it! Nothing even comes close. Works great on Droid X. Spent hours trying out others. Don't bother! $8.99 is a steal for this user-friendly app.
 - May 20, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - Droid Bionic &&& 2.13&&&I recommend Astro Player Nova instead!&&&At least until Ambling gets around to adding audio speed control as requested SO many times. I might consider coming back then but I doubt it. Uninstalled.
 - April 2, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - HTC Evo 4G &&& 2.13&&&Simply The Best&&&I have used this audiobook reader for years and love it. It bookmarks, groups for series and remembers then if you have to delete a book temporarily. Also allotted you to add your own cover art.

 - May 24, 2012&&&4.0 &&& - Motorola Atrix &&& 2.13&&&Good player.&&&I've been using this player for two years. I've loved it. But its been a long time since any improvements. I'd like to see it automatically load files instead of the laborious, complicated system it has now. Each file has to be manually loaded into the library. Editing the loaded file names/titles  is a great option. A new widget with cover art would be nice too. Make a good player great.

 - February 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Motorola Droid X &&& 2.13&&&The best I've tried (I've tried almost all)&&&I have tried most of the music players that claim to do audiobooks well, and this is far-and-away the best. It does almost anything I ever want to do, and with a well-thought-out and intuitive interface. The automatic bookmark system is especially good; that's a little ironic because, unlike all the others I've tried, this one seems to almost never lose its place, thus making auto bookmarks less necessary.   I could see how good it would be from the free app, but the pro was worth the money--for me especially for the sleep timer.  (Droid X)
 - February 11, 2012&&&4.0 &&&&&& - Version 2.13&&&Great app!&&&5 stars if we could simply delete more than 1 audio file (multiselect) from an audiobook at a time. It's inconvenient to individually delete two or more files.
