So, I figured that the application would be compatible with my Xperia pro since it too uses the same Android OS as the two models listed on the application's page.  Well, it does NOT.  If you have a Sony Ericsson Xperia cell phone, do not buy this application as it will likely not work!  The application apparently records the conversation, but then it will not let you play it back.
