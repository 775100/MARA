 - December 30, 2011&&&5.0 &&& - SEMC Xperia Arc &&& 1.07&&&Great App&&&Glad this app is now available for Android as I have been using it on Symbian for years. Works seamless with all my devices. Great app to have and cheap.
 - January 12, 2012&&&1.0 &&& - HTC Desire HD &&& 1.07&&&Problems&&&Have been using this app for a while. upgraded to Android 2.3.5 a few days ago from which time I have been unable to open handy safe.It does not recognize the password. I have emailed the developers twice for help but there has been no response. I am very surprised and disappointed at the lack of response. Without adequate backup any app is worse than useless.

 - January 28, 2012&&&5.0 &&& - Galaxy Tab 10.1 &&& 1.07&&&Great cross-platform app, BUT&&&If you install it on a Galaxy TAB 10.1 it will prevent you from connecting it to Kies (prevents the usb service app on theTAB to start). Force close or uninstall will fix it. Bob
 - April 10, 2012&&&2.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.07&&&USB Syncing between my GS2 and iMac is a nightmare&&&I would give a 4 star but for the USB syncing. On my iPhone syncing HS Pro via OTA is simple.   On the GS2 I struggle with USB. The instructions are wrong, and it is impossible to eject the SD cards safely when I finally manage to sync!  Please introduce OTA syncing ASAP...
 - November 7, 2011&&&5.0 &&&&&& - Version 1.07&&&Really useful app&&&I've used this app for years on Symbian and am really glad it's now available for Android.
